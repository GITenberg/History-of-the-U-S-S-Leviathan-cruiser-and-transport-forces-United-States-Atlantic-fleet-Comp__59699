<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This is the story of the <i>Leviathan’s</i> part in the Great World’s War.
The story of her career since the Stars and Stripes displaced the
three barred flag of Germany at her taffrail constitutes one of the
most remarkable and brilliant chapters in the maritime history of the
world.</p>

<p>She was seized by the U. S. Customs officials in the early morning
of April 6, 1917, turned over to the Shipping Board to be manned and
operated, but after nearly three months’ effort on their part without
the ship leaving the dock, she was finally, on July 25, 1917, turned
over to the Navy Department and regularly commissioned as a Naval
vessel and assigned to transport duty under the command of Vice-Admiral
Albert Gleaves, U. S. Navy, Commander of the Cruiser and
Transport Force, United States Atlantic Fleet.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan’s</i> record for carrying human beings across the ocean
has never been approached by any other vessel in the history of the
world. Back and forth she went across the Atlantic, almost with the
regularity of clockwork, passing unscathed a score of times through
the war zone, though the German submarines made several attempts in
force to get her. Her performance constitutes one of the greatest
marine achievements of the world and it would seem that fate had
designed her to fulfil a mission of retributive justice.</p>

<p>The Germans said it could not be done, but true to their nature, they
had not figured on the ingenuity, initiative and pluck of the American
sailor. When the Armistice was signed this three-funnelled colossus
of the waves had made ten trips across the Atlantic as a naval transport
and had landed a grand total of 110,591 American soldiers in France
and England. In other words, this single ship had transported to
Europe one twentieth of the total number of the American Expeditionary
Force.</p>

<p>This tremendous achievement did not depend alone upon the great
size and speed of the ship; it was accomplished also by the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
spirit of the officers and men of the <i>Leviathan</i> and their unfailing devotion
to duty. It was due to their pride in their ship and their personal
loyalty to Vice-Admiral Gleaves, their Force Commander, that kept the
<i>Leviathan</i> constantly straining to do her best, and this spirit remained
with the ship after the Armistice and nowhere is it better illustrated
than in the records of the 15th and 16th trips, on which she returned
to the United States a total of 28,412 troops, which amounted to 2,217
more than were carried on her two best previous voyages. These two
trips were made in the fastest time she had ever made, less than 37
days elapsing for the two voyages.</p>

<p>Thus during the war, in rushing troops to France, and after the
Armistice in the great task of bringing them home again, the <i>Leviathan</i>
proved herself of greatest value to the government and her great achievement
will forever remain an undying credit to the United States Navy,
and the men of the Navy who manned her.</p>

<h2>PREFACE BY SECRETARY DANIELS</h2>

<p>The record of the <i>U.S.S. Leviathan</i>, queen of the troop transport
fleet which made possible the successful participation of
the United States in the war with Germany, is a record of consistent
service and remarkable efficiency which upholds the best and
noblest traditions of the United States naval service. The nation owes
and gladly gives a great meed of praise to every officer and man,
regular and reserve alike, who shared in the hardships, the dangers
and the successes of the <i>Leviathan’s</i> great wartime service.</p>

<p>The potential strength of the 98,000 fighting men the <i>Leviathan</i>
carried to the shores of France can never be estimated. We know
that when the night was blackest, when the fortunes of the world hung
in the balance and the eyes of all nations were turned toward the
western continent, that the great <i>Leviathan</i> with her tremendous troop-carrying
capacity was ready and that, trip after trip, without failures
or accidents, the great transport plowed her way across the Atlantic,
scornful alike of the submarine’s stilettos of the sea and the wrath
of the elements, carrying to the shores of our nearly exhausted allies
those inestimably precious cargoes of men who turned the tide and
saved the day.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Leviathan</i> did not participate in any great naval
engagement, although the battle flags never flew proudly at her mast-heads
as she swept into the tempest of a modern naval engagement,
her achievement in carrying across the sea more than three divisions
of American soldiers entitles the gallant ship’s name to a place forever
in the hall of American naval fame.</p>

<p>I cannot but feel a thrill of admiration for the efficiency, loyalty and
devotion to duty of the officers and men of the <i>Leviathan</i> who repaired
the damage wrought by the Germans, quickly and skillfully organized
the ship for service at sea and who, week after week and month after
month, “carried on” regardless of the lurking menace beneath the
waves, in the face of an enemy who would have made any sacrifice to
add the giant <i>Leviathan</i> to his list of victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 15, 1919, Mrs. Daniels and myself had the pleasure of
going aboard the <i>Leviathan</i> with a party of naval officers who were accompanying
me to Europe on important public business. The remembrance
of this voyage will ever be among the most cherished memories
of all the members of our party. The never-failing courtesy and
kindness of both officers and men, the thoughtful consideration with
which we were treated, will always cause us to remember the U.S.S.
Leviathan with the warmest personal regard.</p>

<p>With all good wishes for the future for the crew of the <i>Leviathan</i>
and the hope that the ship’s great work, so wonderfully carried out
thus far, may be as successfully completed.</p>

<h2>Executive Order</h2>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, the following Joint Resolution adopted by Congress was
approved by the President May 12, 1917:</p>

<p>“Joint Resolution Authorizing the President to take over for the
United States the possession and title of any vessel within its jurisdiction,
which at the time of coming therein was owned in whole or in part by
any corporation, citizen, or subject of any nation with which the United
States may be at war, or was under register of any nation and for other
purposes.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled: That the President
be, and he is hereby, authorized to take over to the United States the
immediate possession and title of any vessel within the jurisdiction
thereof, including the Canal Zone, and all territories and insular possessions
of the United States, except the American Virgin Islands, which at
the time of coming into such jurisdiction was owned in whole or in
part by any corporation, citizen, or subject of any nation with which
the United States may be at war when such vessel shall be taken, or was
flying the flag of or was under register of any such nation or any
political subdivision or municipality thereof; and, through the United
States Shipping Board, or any department or agency of the Government,
to operate, lease, charter, and equip such vessel in any service of the
United States, or in any commerce, foreign or coastwise.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. That the Secretary of the Navy be, and he is hereby,
authorized and directed to appoint, subject to the approval of the
President, a board of survey, whose duty it shall be to ascertain the
actual value of the vessel, its equipment, appurtenances and all property
contained therein, at the time of its taking, and to make a written report
of their findings to the Secretary of the Navy, who shall preserve such
report with the records of his department. These findings shall be
considered as competent evidence in all proceedings on any claim for
compensation.</p>

<p><i>And whereas</i>, the following vessels were, at the time of coming
into the jurisdiction of the United States, owned in whole or in part
by a corporation, citizen or subject of the Empire of Germany, a nation
with which the United States is now at war, or were flying the flag of
or under the register of the Empire of Germany, or of a political subdivision
or municipality thereof:</p>

<span class="smaller">The United States Takes Over the German
Merchant Ship, “Vaterland”</span></h2>

<h3>REPAIRING THE “VATERLAND”</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Organization and Trial Trip</span></h3>

<p class="author">O. J. H.</p>

<p>When the <i>Vaterland</i> of the Hamburg-American Line was
taken over by the United States Navy it was found to be in
urgent need of repairs throughout and the work of fitting the
ship out for service as a Navy Transport was accomplished
by civilian labor and the ship’s force. The force at that time
consisted of men of the Regular Navy and the United States
Naval Reserve Force. These men worked long and faithfully
to accomplish a task which the Germans claimed could not
be done.</p>

<p>One of the hardest propositions that was accomplished
aboard the ship was the repairing and the tracing up of the
plumbing of the ship, <i>i. e.</i>, the fresh water and salt water lines.
The plans of this plumbing could not be found and had
evidently been destroyed by the German crew. In a great
many instances it was found that lead fresh water lines had
been cut and the ends squeezed together. In other instances
entire sections of lines were cut out altogether and from investigation
it looked as if this was done maliciously when it
was rumored that these vessels were to be seized by the
United States Government. These pipe lines are all installed
behind the panelling of the ship and when the water was first
turned on numerous floods were caused throughout the ship.
An amusing incident occurred on the trial trip to Guantanamo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Bay, Cuba, when the entire forward section of the ship’s
officers’ rooms on the starboard side was flooded with about
fourteen inches of water.</p>

<p>The work of refitting deck gear and getting in shape
lifeboat equipment was accomplished entirely by the ship’s
force and when the ship was finally ready for oversea service
she carried more lifeboats than any other ship afloat. The
outboard lifeboats, except in a few cases, are fitted with the
Welin gear. This gear is electrically operated and when a
boat is sent out over the ship’s sides it can be dropped from
the highest deck, <i>i. e.</i>, “A” deck, to the water with safety
within sixty seconds. There is life equipment aboard, consisting
of lifeboats and the latest type of life rafts for over
17,000 persons, so that a landsman sailing on board the
<i>Leviathan</i> is well provided for and need not worry.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> is without doubt the most wonderfully
constructed vessel below the water-line in the world. The ship
is subdivided into fourteen water-tight compartments and every
precaution was taken from the time the ship sailed from the
Port of Embarkation until her return, to safeguard the vessel.
The officers and men were untiring in their efforts. During
a period of ten months and twenty-six days, this vessel carried
over 100,000 persons, a total of approximately one-twentieth of
the entire American Expeditionary Forces which were landed
overseas. Four or five thousand additional troops could have
been carried on board, but for the health and comfort and safety
of all concerned, this additional number were not transported.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> is the only vessel in the American Transport
Service which can sustain a speed of twenty knots
across the Atlantic regardless of weather conditions. A vessel,
one of the Navy Transports, claims that she beat the <i>Leviathan</i>
by three hours in a homeward bound voyage, but the <i>Leviathan</i>
steamed 100 more miles in return than this other ship and
also had to slow down when within fourteen hours of New
York on account of the height of the tide, as she can only
go through the Ambrose Channel, the entrance to New York,
at high tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> made a round trip in sixteen days and
eighteen hours; this included a stop of forty-eight hours
overseas to coal ship. At that time she took on board over
1,500 tons of fresh water and 4,500 tons of coal. This coal
was placed alongside in lighters and was discharged by a
working force of Army stevedores on the starboard side and
the ship’s company on the port side. In addition to this the
cargo was handled and discharged by the ship’s force, this
being a creditable record. The commanding officer, officers
and crew received a telegram of commendation from Vice-Admiral
H. B. Wilson and Admiral Sims.</p>

<p>According to a New York newspaper the credit was given
to an Army Quartermaster officer. This officer had nothing to
do with the handling of the cargo, the coaling of the vessel,
or debarkation of troops, except to supply a working party of
stevedores to assist the ship’s force in coaling. The coaling
of this vessel by the ship’s force, when from 4,500 to 5,000
tons of coal are taken on, is a large task, the largest coaling
proposition ever accomplished by a Navy crew, as our largest
battleships only carry about 2,800 tons of coal and they coal
from colliers which are fitted with modern machinery for
handling coal cargoes.</p>

<p>Too much credit cannot be given to the crew of the
<i>Leviathan</i>. They worked faithfully, earnestly and cheerfully.
The men were all young, the probable average age being not
more than twenty years. They were clean cut Americans, well
behaved and willing and anxious to carry out orders and to
whip the Germans.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Seizure of the “Vaterland” by the United States</span></h3>

<p>When the World War broke out the <i>Vaterland</i>, Germany’s
largest passenger ship, was at her pier in Hoboken, New Jersey,
ready to sail August 1, 1914. A mass meeting was held on
this date at Atlantic Garden, Hoboken, by firemen, seamen,
oilers and machinists of German ships in Hoboken, to discuss
the war. All German ships that were in Hoboken had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ordered not to sail. Being a part of the German Naval Reserve
they were subject to the orders of the German Admiralty.
The <i>Vaterland</i> had booked 720 first class, 420 second class
and 2,500 third class and steerage passengers. The Hamburg-American
Line lost more than $500,000 as a result of keeping
the <i>Vaterland</i> from sailing on August 1st.</p>

<p>The piers were stormed by angry crowds that had expected
to sail and had purchased their tickets. The Hoboken
police had much difficulty in handling the disappointed crowds.
An extra guard was placed around the ship and at night
searchlights and inspectors guarded the giant ship.</p>

<p>Ten thousand German reservists on August 6th, demanded
of the German consul that they be sent back to
Germany on the <i>Vaterland</i> so that they could join their regiments.
There were nine German ships in Hoboken at this
time—the <i>Prinzess Irene</i>, <i>Friedrich der Grosse</i>, <i>Vaterland</i>,
<i>President Lincoln</i>, <i>Pennsylvania</i>, <i>Barbarossa</i>, <i>Prince Joachim</i>,
<i>George Washington</i> and <i>Martha Washington</i>.</p>

<p>Count Von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador, arrived
in Hoboken from Germany on the <i>S. S, Noordam</i>, on August
24th, for a brief visit.</p>

<p>The clearing ship for all German officers in this country
was the <i>Aeolus</i>. These officers came from all parts of the
world. They had secret orders to go aboard that particular
ship and stay until all arrangements were made for them to
travel aboard outbound steamers. These officers played an
important part in the interest and welfare of the Fatherland.
This continued until the United States entered the war, when
all German ships on this side were seized. The captain of the
<i>Aeolus</i>, the chief engineer and the purser were ordered to
Philadelphia to take ship to Germany. They ran the English
blockade and succeeded in getting home. This captain was
given command of a Zeppelin. He made a few successful raids,
but was afterwards brought down and killed near London.
When news of his death came all the flags on German ships
were hoisted at half mast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>On board the <i>Friedrich der Grosse</i> (renamed <i>Huron</i>),
the entire personnel were kept busy making bombs. These
bombs were carried off the ship in separate parts and assembled
at the main factory in Hoboken, which was disguised
as a fertilizer plant. This was soon broken up, the men tried
and sent to jail.</p>

<p>The officers and men interned had many schemes for
making money. A bazaar held at Madison Square Garden,
New York, cleared at least $85,000 in a week. Moonlight
excursion trips up the Hudson netted more money. This money
was supposed to be for the wives, mothers and children of the
men, but through the craftiness of a high functionary it was
used for his own personal benefit and the upkeep of the
German spy system. It was found that he used some of this
money also for private speculation.</p>

<p>When news of the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> came the German
sailors celebrated and German officials made ready to
destroy German ships in port at a moment’s notice, for they
knew that war with the United States was imminent. But on
the morning of April 1st, the Germans were surprised to see
one of our destroyers, No. 533, anchored off Pier 2. They
thought this a great joke, but on April 5th, the United States
officials rounded up German officers and men and sent them
to Ellis Island for distribution to Federal prisons.</p>

<p>On this date, United States armed forces seized ninety-one
German ships in different ports. The <i>Vaterland</i> was
taken over at 4 A.&nbsp;M., on the morning of April 5th. The
seizure was made without any trouble or disturbance by
the crew and they were marched off and sent to Ellis Island
for transfer to Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. The night before the
seizure took place, a conference was held on the <i>Vaterland</i>
between three representatives of the American Government and
the German commanders of the interned vessels. The German
commanders were given to understand that there must not be
any violence when the ships were taken over. They made no
resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The English Navy maintained a steady and vigilant patrol
outside the three-mile limit of America.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Description of the Vaterland and General Data</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Vaterland</i> was built at Cuxhaven, Germany, by Blohm
and Voss, shipbuilders, of Hamburg, assisted by German naval
architects and German army engineers. It was launched in
the early part of 1914.</p>

<p>The ship is equipped with 46 Yarrow boilers, German
built, and are arranged in four firerooms separated by four
watertight bulkheads. 8,731 tons of coal are carried and an
average of 700 tons at 17½ knots up to 900 tons at 21½
knots, is burned during twenty-four hours. 5,670 tons of
fresh water are carried. This allowed every man aboard,
including troops carried later and crew, six gallons per day.
Cooking, drinking and water for washing is included in these
figures. The ship is divided into fourteen watertight compartments
and all doors in the engine room spaces are controlled
by compressed air and may be closed from the bridge
by a master lever in case of accident or emergency.</p>

<p>The following list of dimensions may also be of interest:
The bridge is 87 feet above the water-line. The boat deck is
101 feet above the keel. From the top of the smokestacks to
the water-line is 146 feet. Fore and aft diameter of funnels
is 29 feet. Athwartships diameter of funnels is 18 feet.</p>

<p>A crew of 1,200 was carried by the Germans and a
crew of 2,240 was carried when operated by the United States
Navy. This included gun’s crews, additional men for coaling
at Brest, and a training complement. The ship is driven by four
propellers. The shafts to which these propellers are attached
are twenty-one inches in diameter. The propellers have four
blades and are without a doubt the largest in existence, being
fourteen feet from tip to tip. The shafts are driven by eight
Parsons turbines, four in a cruising combination and four in
a manœuvering combination.</p>

<p>The ship is equipped with five passenger and six freight
elevators, each capable of lifting more than a ton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The rudder and steering gear are the largest known and
the rudder and steering engine are the largest and most powerful
installed on any vessel afloat.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A German Account of the Seizure</span></h3>

<p>The following is a translation of a clipping from a German
newspaper, the <i>Tageblatt</i> of Wurtemberg, taken from a
dead German soldier, by a first-class private of Headquarters
Troop, 27th Division, A. E. F.:</p>

<p>It was translated and loaned by him to the ship’s history
committee while en route from France to the United States on
board the <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<p>The soldier while serving as an interpreter and doing
intelligence work with the headquarters came upon this clipping
in a queer manner on or about August 31, 1918, immediately
after Kemmel Hill had been evacuated by the Germans.
The lines had formerly been held by the British and had been
stationary for about four months until the Twenty-seventh and
Thirtieth American divisions were given that sector. After
being in the line a short while the Germans evacuated, fearing
that the Americans might attack and his Imperial Majesty’s
Army had no wish to meet up with some of Uncle Sam’s fire-eaters.
While going over the field after the Germans had left,
this man came upon a German soldier who had been shot in
the head. He evidently had been dead for some weeks. Being
a part of his work and duty, he took from the pocket of the dead
man a newspaper, expecting to find some information that might
prove valuable. He found the following translation which
he immediately cut out and saved to show a friend on the
<i>Leviathan</i>,</p>

<p class="center">Wie man aus »Vaterland« den »Leviathan« machte.</p>
<p>Als die Amerikaner am 6. April 1917, am Tage
der Kriegserklärung, den Dampfer »Vaterland« mit
Beschlag belegten und die Besatzung von Bord
brachten, fanden sie die Maschinen unbrauchbar gemacht.
Es dauerte Monate, bis es ihnen gelang,
das Schiff so weit auszubessern, daß es wieder seetüchtig
wurde. Das Schiff war auch zu ganz anderen
Zwecken bestimmt als der Massenverschiffung von
Soldaten und Munition. Um es einigermaßen
seiner neuen Bestimmung anzupassen fielen die
Amerikaner, lt. Köln. Z., wie die Vandalen mit
Äxten und Sägen und Hämmern über den stolzen
Bau her und rissen die kostbare Inneneinrichtung
mit solcher schmachvollen Rücksichtslosigkeit heraus,
daß die prachtvollen Edelhölzer nur noch als Brennholz
zu verwerten waren: 20 Eisenbahnwagen
wurden mit den Trümmern gefüllt und in Hoboken
verkauft. Nur das große Gemälde im Treppenhause
wurde herausgenommen und im Hotel Baltimore
aufgehängt. Von den erhofften 12000 oder gar
15000 Soldaten war kaum die Hälfte unterzubringen,
wie überhaupt die gestohlenen Personendampfer
der beiden deutschen Linien nicht die
Fassungskraft aufwiesen, die man ihnen zugeschrieben
hatte. Mit den 16 deutschen Schiffen waren im
ganzen nur rund 28000 Mann und 5500 Offiziere
auf einmal zu befördern, und die Hoffnungen der
Amerikaner erfuhren infolgedessen eine empfindliche
Enttäuschung. Die geraubte deutsche Flotte ist
schon recht erheblich gelichtet worden, denn unter den
40 versenkten Truppenschiffen der Amerikaner befanden
sich sicherlich verschiedene deutsche. Mindestens
wissen wir aus amerikanischen Quellen, daß
der »Präsident Lincoln« am 31. Mai einem deutschen
Torpedo zum Opfer fiel, und nun ist die »Vaterland«
gefolgt. »Präsident Lincoln« war eines der
vier Schiffe, denen die Räuber den ursprünglichen
Namen belassen hatten: die andern drei sind der
»George Washington«, der »Präsident Grant« und
die »Pennsylvania«. Die »Vaterland« dagegen
wurde in »Leviathan« umgetauft, die »Kronprinzessin
Cecilie« in »Mont Vernon«, der »Kaiser Wilhelm
II.« in »Agamemnon« und der »Amerika« in
»America«.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">How the “Vaterland” Was Made Into the “Leviathan”</span></p>

<p>On the Declaration of War, April 6, 1917, the American
robbers seized the steamer <i>Vaterland</i> along with others of the German
merchant fleet that was interned in the United States. The
crew and most all the ship’s equipment have been taken off.
However, they found the machinery unfit for use and it took
them months to repair it and get the ship in a seaworthy condition.
The big ship was never built to carry troops and ammunition,
and to make it fit for such uses the thieves tore out all of
our beautiful art and all of the fine woodwork, regardless of all
feeling. Twenty freight cars full of wood and furnishings were
taken from the ship and loaded in Hoboken to be burned. Only
one great painting was accounted for. This was located above
C deck at No. 1 stairway, and it now hangs in the Hotel ——
in New York. They hope to accommodate 12,000 or 15,000
troops. This they will never be able to do, not even half that
amount. On the sixteen stolen ships there was only room for
28,000 men and 5,500 officers, so the Americans will have to
change their hopes.</p>

<p>The stolen German fleet has been greatly reduced, for surely
of the forty troopships that have been sunk there must have been
some of ours amongst them. Nevertheless, we know through
American sources that the <i>President Lincoln</i> fell to the mercy of
a German torpedo on May 31st. The <i>President Lincoln</i> was one
of the four sister ships seized by the robbers. The other three
were the <i>George Washington</i>, <i>President Grant</i>, and the <i>Pennsylvania</i>.
Some names have been changed to the following: The
<i>Vaterland</i> to the <i>Leviathan</i>, the <i>Kronprinzessin Cecilie</i> to the
<i>Mount Vernon</i>, the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm II</i> to the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the
<i>Amerika</i> to the <i>America</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Vaterland</i> lay at Hoboken with her German complement
of officers and men intact and protected by the splendid
neutrality of the American Government. To the date of the
declaration of war, April 6, 1917 (Good Friday, 1.13 P.&nbsp;M.),
the huge ship aided the German Red Cross by a series of
social entertainments on board given under the auspices of
ship’s officers. A great number of prominent people attended
these fetes.</p>

<p>Early in April, 1917, the ship was taken over by the
United States Customs Officials. The customs officials inspected
her and put aboard guards which were later replaced by several
civilian employees of the U. S. Customs. The guard was increased
later to about sixty men from the Police Reserve from
the 37th Precinct, New York City.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Damage Done to Ship Before Seizure</span></h3>

<p>The lower decks were found to be in a filthy and unsanitary
condition, only the upper decks, open to inspection, were
found clean and inviting. The ship’s furnishings in the staterooms
and public assembly rooms were magnificent and
showed a high degree of taste and art. The paintings of different
notables, Bismarck, Lincoln, Washington, Roosevelt, etc.,
were later removed. In the engine room, fire room and dynamo
space, much deterioration had taken place.</p>

<p>The vast accumulation of ship’s stores and provisions,
the high class wines, the magnificent table linens and china
and glass ware and about $150,000 worth of silver ware were
taken off the ship and placed on the pier for further disposition.
Much of the medical supplies and provisions as well
as different furnishings from the staterooms were found
to be missing. It is said that these were taken by the German
personnel before the ship was taken over by the American
authorities. The latter destroyed some of the medical stores
found on board fearing that drugs and medicines might have
been tampered with and poisonous drugs compounded with
non-poisonous and placed in chests bearing false labels.</p>

<p>A marine construction company sent down divers to do
necessary work scraping the bottom and to locate the propellers.
Owing to the destruction or disappearance of all
blue prints as to the location of the various propellers, it was
a matter of some delay. These blue prints were later found
in the Hamburg-American Line’s office and some of them
proved inaccurate. United States Secret Service Agents raided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Hamburg-American’s office on Broadway, New York City
and discovered them with other secret diplomatic correspondence
showing the machinations of Germany in Mexico and
South America. In the hull of the ship many articles of German
handiwork and craftsmanlike skill were found, such as
small toys, probably carved by the crew for sale among the
visitors to the ship in order to obtain some spending money.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Vaterland</i> numbered 1,200 during her
transatlantic voyages. But at the time of her seizure they
numbered only about 300 as a large number of the crew, in
order to make a livelihood, left the ship and established themselves
in different positions in hotels and restaurants of nearby
cities and upon other ships.</p>

<p>When the United States Customs Officials took charge, at
4 A.&nbsp;M., April 6th, they searched everybody who came aboard
thereafter and detected a number of men having articles of
destruction. Several attempts to smuggle small bombs and explosives
into the coal chutes from the coal barges alongside were
frustrated by the guards. When the Navy took over coaling
the ship, a more vigilant guard was maintained. The guards
had orders to keep off all unauthorized boats at a distance of
100 yards. There was much reason for this strict order.
The United States Customs Officials turned over the <i>Vaterland</i>
to the United States Shipping Board. Among the shipping
board employees was a number of hardy Filipino and Hawaiian
firemen, very sturdy and enthusiastic about their work. They
were presumably from merchant ships in or about the harbor
and they gladly offered their services in behalf of their adopted
country. “Africans” was a favorite sport with them.</p>

<p>During the hot spell of July, 1917, several of the Filipino
firemen were affected by the intense heat and were removed
to the hospital for observation. All employees on the ship had
their identification cards with their photograph attached.
Hoboken was a hotbed of pro-Germanism and our officials
could not be too careful.</p>

<p>At 10 A.&nbsp;M., July 25, 1917, the American flag was hoisted
under the orders of the Navy Department. This interesting
ceremony, which meant so much to the oppressed peoples of
the world, was witnessed by only a few men. The first draft
of seventy-one firemen came aboard later in the day. The main
dining room was converted into a mess hall for the troops,
and the beautiful swimming pool of Pompeiian decoration was
turned into a baggage room. The after baggage room was
turned into a brig (or ship’s prison), and a powder magazine.</p>

<p>The first entry in the official log of the former German
ship <i>Vaterland</i> follows:</p>

<p>At 10 A.&nbsp;M., July 25, 1917, the <i>U. S. S. Vaterland</i> was
placed in commission by Captain J. W. Oman, U. S. N., in accordance
with letter C-467-4 from the Commandant of the Navy Yard,
New York.</p>

<p>The watch was set. The following officers were attached to
this ship:</p>

<p>Captain J. W. Oman, U. S. N.; Ensign A. H. Bateman,
U. S. N.; Assistant Paymaster L. B. Foster, U. S. N. R. F.; Assistant
Paymaster H. B. Judkins, U. S. N. R. F. Fifty-five (55)
workmen were on board, work going on in the engineering
department and on deck under the direction of the shipping board
and customs officials. Divers cleaning bottom.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Named “Leviathan”</span></h3>

<p>On September 6th the name of the German ship <i>Vaterland</i>
was changed by order of the Secretary of the Navy, without
ceremony, to the <i>U. S. S. Leviathan</i>, meaning monster of the
deep and mentioned in the Book of Job in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>On September 26th there was a large amount of “Imperial”
sausage received aboard.</p>

<p>In the latter part of October, 1917, the big caliber guns
were placed upon their respective mounts. A depth charge
chute was erected on the stern and fire control and range finding
apparatus were installed to insure the accuracy of the guns.</p>

<p>All the staterooms on the lower decks of the ship were
ripped out to make room for standees, which are an open iron
frame work with canvas bunk bottoms to be occupied by the
troops in transit to France.</p>

<p>Work was begun in the main theatre and ball room to
convert it into a hospital for troops and crew during transatlantic
voyages.</p>

<p>An isolation ward was established in the gymnasium on
“A” Deck for contagious cases. The ship’s doctor’s office was
used as a sick call station and dispensary for troops and crew.</p>

<p>Dock trials took place in the morning watch of November
12th. These trials lasted until 2 P.&nbsp;M. The ship reported
ready for sea and on November 17, 1917, a trial trip to Cuba
was made.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Crew—Ship’s Organization</span></h3>

<p>Before describing the trial trip it is well to say something
here of the crew and the ship’s organization, which was a vital
factor in the successful operation of the <i>Leviathan</i> and its participation
in the World War.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Leviathan</i> is divided into two main parts,
one part consisting of the deck divisions and the other of the
engineer’s division. The deck force is composed of nine divisions
all told, four of which do the deck work proper and five of
which are special branches. The deck divisions are divided
into four sections each and the engineer’s division into three
sections. Each man of the crew is assigned a number which
gives his division, section and personal number. For instance,
the man holding the number 841 would be the first man in the
fourth section of the eighth division. The first figure of the
number is the division, the second figure the section and the
third figure or third and fourth figures together is the man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
number. The men of the deck force wear a white band around
the left arm at the shoulder on blue uniforms, and a blue band
on white uniforms. The men of the engineer’s force wear a red
band on both blue and white uniforms. The petty officers of the
deck force proper wear their rating badges on the right arm
and all other petty officers wear them on the left arm.</p>

<p>The first, second, third and fourth divisions are the men
detailed for the deck work, manning guns, lookouts, fire control,
etc. The first division has the fore part of the ship or forecastle;
the second division the top deck; the third division the
inside decks and the fourth division the after part of the ship.
The fifth division is known as the repair division, and consists
of the carpenters, painters, plumbers, buglers, yeomen and
other men of special ratings.</p>

<p>The sixth division is known as the navigators’ division
and consists of the quartermasters and signalmen. The seventh
division is the hospital corpsmen. The eighth division is the
Supply division and consists of the personnel of the Pay and
Commissary branches and the mess attendants or waiters.</p>

<p>The ninth division is known as the Bluejacket guard and
has the policing of the ship, also furnishes orderlies for the
Commanding and Executive officer and all ship’s guards.</p>

<p>The tenth division is the engineer’s force consisting of
half the ship’s crew, and includes all men working in the
engine rooms, firerooms, and dynamo rooms. The radio force
of the ship is also included in this division.</p>

<p>The ship’s complement is 68 officers and 2,240 men.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Trial Trip</span></h3>

<p class="author">G. B. G.</p>

<p>“I have to report that the Engineering Department of
this vessel is in all respects ready for sea.”</p>

<p>Thus read Lieut. V. V. Woodward’s official report to
Captain J. W. Oman, November 16, 1917, an expression of
confidence not unanimously shared by the crew or public. The
Captain, Engineer Officer, the Navy Department, were confident
she would leave despite boasts to the contrary by German
agents and sympathizers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Promptly at 9:30 A.&nbsp;M., November 17, 1917, upon
signals from the bridge, steam was admitted to the <i>Leviathan’s</i>
great turbines, the hull was felt to quiver slightly, and the
greatest passenger carrying ship on the ocean backed smoothly
from her moorings of three years into the North River. Here
was another triumph of Yankee ingenuity.</p>

<p>No blare of brass bands was heard, no cheering crowds
thronged the river front, as, amid a fleet of eighteen tugs, the
former pride of the German maritime world, manned by an
all-American crew, straightened her course and under her own
power, headed slowly for the open sea.</p>

<p>On board were 241 marines, in addition to the crew,
bound for Cuba to relieve a detachment of seasoned “Devil
Dogs.” Prior to sailing, Captain Oman had issued an order,
stationing these men in conspicuous positions about the upper
decks, giving the appearance from the river front that thousands
of troops were bound overseas to swell the numbers of
the American Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>Anchorage was made off Fort Wadsworth that afternoon
to permit a thorough inspection of machinery spaces. The
result was that “The Engineering Department was in all respects
ready for sea,” for, aside from a few minor repairs,
the renewal of a gasket here, a nut tightened there, no defects
were revealed.</p>

<p>At high tide the morning of the 18th, she steamed slowly
through Ambrose Channel, shifted to high pressure cruising
combination and began speeding eastwards at eighteen knots.</p>

<p>Numerous craft sighted the <i>Leviathan</i>, her course was
noted by westbound steamers and thus was the rumor “confirmed”
that she was on her initial trip to France, laden with
thousands of troops.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, under the supervision of Lieut. C. H.
Boucher, gun crews were given instructions. Small arms,
abandon ship, and fire and collision drills interfered seriously
with the sighting of flying fish, leaping porpoises, and the
discussion of “Why is the Gulf Stream?”</p>

<p>Trouble was first encountered on the 19th, when a valve
stem on the differential valve of the port steering engine broke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The ship is equipped with two steering engines and the starboard
engine was quickly cut in and the voyage resumed.
Similar trouble occurred the succeeding day, leaving the ship
without power to hold her course. The engines were stopped
and the <i>Leviathan</i> lay helpless, a plaything of the winds and
currents.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Anxious Hours</span></h3>

<p>These were anxious hours for the officers and crew alike.
Sleep was forgotten, personal comforts were of secondary
importance. Lieut. Woodward haunted the steering engine
room, pored over blue prints, conferred with assistants,
advised and worked with the men. New stems fitted to replace
the broken ones, permitted runs of short duration, then they,
too, broke under the strain. A quantity of these stems, broken
and twisted, were found in a store room, an indication that its
former operators had experienced trouble of this nature.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours the crippled ship made spasmodic
runs to the northward; first one, then the other, then both steering
engines became inoperative. The Engineer Officer grew
haggard. The ship’s doctor insisted that he get some sleep, but
a few hours’ restless tossing upon a couch, and he would be
seen again, making his way aft to the steering engine room.</p>

<p>The solution of the problem came to Lieut. Woodward
during one of these brief respites. Clad in greasy dungarees,
reclining upon a couch, following thirty-six hours of constant
toil, Lieut. Woodward suddenly jumped to his feet and
assembled the tired mechanics, and explained his plan. The
machine shop was invaded and a new stem of heavier design
and altered pattern was fitted.</p>

<p>Then, under the anxious eyes of the Captain, Engineer
Officer and First Lieutenant, a test was made. The throttle
was thrown clear over, permitting the engine to race, and the
new stem held. It is still holding, like its mate of similar
design, after more than 100,000 miles through the wind-swept
North Atlantic.</p>

<p>During the voyage south to Cuba, the crew shifted into
white uniforms. The port holes were closed tight and painted
deep black. All precautions were taken against unexpected
attack. We passed close aboard Matling Island, or San Salvador
whereon Columbus first set foot in the New World.</p>

<p>We rounded Cape Maysi Light and headed up for the
harbor of Guantanamo Bay. While changing troops at the
mouth of the harbor, our great draft precluding our entrance,
the men-of-warsmen initiated the rookies into the delights of
shark-catching.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Catching Shark</span></h3>

<p class="author">L. G. M.</p>

<p>While lying at anchor off the beautiful harbor of Guantanamo
Bay, those of the crew who were off watch were lounging
around the open decks and enjoying the heat of the tropical
sun. Among the crew were some old navy men who had
visited this port before and knew from experience that these
waters were infested with sharks. They suggested that a line,
hook and bait of some kind be procured and an attempt be
made to catch sharks.</p>

<p>The necessary articles were obtained, the hook being
double-pronged. To this was tied a whole cow’s liver—a
juicy and inviting piece of bait.</p>

<p>The waters of the bay were calm and from “B” deck,
when the fishing line, which was of 1 inch hemp, was thrown
over, one could see the hook and bait fully thirty feet below
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>In a short time a large black body with a white belly
swam with lightning swiftness past the line several times, darting
back and forth, but on a sudden it turned, seized the bait
and tried to make off with it. The end of the line on deck
was tied to a stanchion which gave the shark a strong opponent,
and a terrific struggle followed both on deck and in the water,
for as soon as Mr. Shark struck, about 40 men grabbed
the line and began to run across the deck, pulling the fighting
monster out of the water onto the deck.</p>

<p>As soon as the shark landed on deck every one scattered,
for the big fish began frantically to lash his powerful tail and
snap his jaws. No one dared approach him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally when the shark was exhausted, one of the
<i>Leviathan’s</i> butchers drove a cleaver into the strong skull and
ended the death struggle. The same piece of bait obtained
three other sharks before it was lost, owing to a slack in the
line, when a ten-footer tried to join the company. The line
broke and the prize, and hook and bait, with about thirty feet
of brand new line, was lost.</p>

<span class="smaller">Running The War Zone</span></h2>

<h3>FIRST VOYAGE TO LIVERPOOL</h3>

<p class="author">S. H.</p>

<p>At 7.34 A.&nbsp;M., December 15, 1917, the <i>Leviathan</i> left
her pier in Hoboken for her first trip across the Atlantic.
Twelve tugs were employed to assist in swinging the bow of the
giant ship toward the sea. The following organizations and
numbers of troops were on board, in addition to some notable
passengers:</p>

<p>No. 7,254. Organizations—Base Hospital, No. 31, Female;
Base Hospital, No. 34, 82nd Brigade Hdqts., 163rd Inf.,
164th Inf.; Commanding Officer, Brig. General Edward Vellruth,
82nd Brigade.</p>

<p>The morning was rather raw, with the snow falling
heavily, but nothing could dampen the ardor of the 7,254
troops and 2,000 sailors on board. We were about to cross
the ocean, most of us for the first time, and the hazard of the
perils of the submarine, whose operations were more active
at this period of the war than at any other time, and the
excitement of the adventure, if nothing else, was sufficient
reason for everyone to keep his spirit up.</p>

<p>Passing through Ambrose Channel, the ship headed for
the open sea with the compass pointing due east and the
propellers revolving at the rate of 158 revolutions per minute,
which is equivalent to 21 knots. Until sundown this same
night, a zig-zag course was maintained, not because of the
danger of submarines, for none were reported off the Atlantic
coast at this time, but in order to give the officers and men
on the bridge an opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted
with this method so as to be familiar with it when in the
danger zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">At Sea</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Abandon ship drills were held this day, all members
on board falling in at their respective boats and rafts in a
quite orderly fashion and lowering the boats in a remarkably
short time.</p>

<p>At 2.00 A.&nbsp;M. the next day, December 16th, lights of
western-bound ships were sighted off the port bow. The sky
was completely overcast, with a rough northwest sea, accompanied
with fresh strong breezes. Our speed averaged 20
knots this day, all 46 boilers in the fireroom being in commission.
The clocks were advanced 47 minutes.</p>

<p>The next day a moderate gale was blowing and we passed
through heavy rain squalls. Due to the heavy sea our speed
was reduced. The sky remained overcast with the barometer
dropping steadily giving little hope of the weather moderating.
The customary drills of abandon ship and fire alarm were gone
through. The water-tight doors, so essential in case of submarine
attacks, were tested and found O. K.</p>

<p>The sea moderated sufficiently the next day to allow us
to increase speed once more, this time to 21½ knots, although
the ship rolled and pitched considerably as the heavy swells
struck her, many of the troops on board showing the effects
of the inevitable <i>mal-de-mer</i>. We passed through a thick fog
when off the Grand Banks.</p>

<p>On the 19th, while holding abandon ship drill, twelve
rounds of ammunition were fired from the various guns, in
order to keep them in tip-top shape and to give their crews the
necessary training in loading and firing. At night the sky
cleared considerably, the first sign of good weather we had
since leaving Hoboken. The barometer rose steadily, a smooth
sea running with a moderate breeze. From day to day we
continued setting our clocks ahead. Up to this time the entire
crew was in ignorance of the ship’s destination, but when the
course was changed to northeast, it was quite apparent to us
that we were headed for “Blighty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>We were passing through the Gulf Stream and the
weather remained clear and fairly warm. A private in Co. H,
163rd Regt., was placed in the brig for safekeeping, at the
request of the brigade commander, demonstrating that the
soldiers on board were subject to the same discipline as were
the crew. Not long after this a member of the crew was disciplined
for failing to wear his life-jacket.</p>

<p>The good weather did not remain with us very long, for
on the 22nd the wind picked up to 65 miles an hour. We
were rapidly approaching the war-zone and the men were
continually cautioned not to neglect wearing their life-preservers
at all times, day and night, not to undress upon turning
in, and never to strike a match on the open deck at night. In
fact, it was contrary to ship regulations for an enlisted man to
carry any matches at all about his person. It is a fact that
the glare of a lighted match or cigarette is visible for half a
mile on the open sea at night and guards vigilantly patrolled
the outer decks in order to prevent any neglect along this line.</p>

<p>About midnight, while running close to the danger zone,
the wire controlling the siren contracted, due to the extreme
cold weather, and like a bolt out of a clear sky, the siren went
off automatically. The siren is used only in case of emergency,
to notify all hands on board of some impending danger, and
going off accidentally as it did caused quite some excitement
on board, especially in the case of the Red Cross nurses.
Many of the latter had been quite seasick the greater part of
the trip, but the excitement tended to relieve them somewhat.
After some difficulty the trouble was remedied.</p>

<p>At 4 A.&nbsp;M., the morning of the 23rd, in a treacherous
sea, our convoy of American destroyers, the famous submarine
annoyers, were picked up. It is hard for one to describe the
feeling and excitement of picking up a convoy of destroyers
at night and we believe that it is quite impossible for the reader
to understand how much it means to 10,000 souls on a ship in
the danger zone when the word is passed that destroyers are
with us. On the morning of December 23rd, at 4 A.&nbsp;M., out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the black sky just before dawn and in a heavy sea with
a strong wind blowing, a small white wake was seen by the
lookout on the bridge. At first it was taken for the wake of
a periscope and the gun crews were called to quarters, then
as the guns were trained on it, a small white flash was seen
blinking the American recognition signal, and we then knew
that it was one of our destroyers. We picked them up out of
the black sky and a heavy sea until there were seven little
wasps that spelled danger to the Hun submarine. They sped
along with us while we zigzagged in and out on our course.
They crossed our bow and ran in and far out on each side of
us, always looking for the sub that might be lying in wait
for us. Their motto was “go get ’em.” They never waited
for a sub to attack first, they always started the fight provided
that “Fritz” was willing to show himself and we want to say
right here that he was very reluctant to do so when an American
destroyer showed itself.</p>

<p>It was difficult to carry on signal communication with the
destroyers in a heavy sea; they were submerged in the trough
so that their slender masts looked like periscopes.</p>

<p>A submarine was reported on the surface of the water
in the early afternoon, about seven miles off the starboard
beam, but upon her flashing out the recognition call we immediately
knew her to belong to one of the Allies, very probably
British. Soon after this a British dirigible was sighted dead
ahead. She was painted aluminum color, rendering her
almost invisible in the distance and apparently she was doing
scouting duty in these waters.</p>

<p>At 5 P.&nbsp;M., the 23rd, South Stack Lighthouse was passed
on our beam, and we headed our course up St. George’s Channel.
After sundown the destroyer that had our pilot on board
took up a position directly ahead of us and acted as guide for
the entire convoy.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, 8.36 P.&nbsp;M., our engines were slowed
down to allow the pilot to board from the destroyer and at
9.42 that night both engines stopped completely and our anchor
was dropped just outside of Liverpool, England, while the
destroyers circled around us during the night, protecting us
from any possible attack. We passed the night in this anchorage.
At 6 A.&nbsp;M. the next day, December 24th, we up-anchored
and headed for the River Mersey, passing close to
Bar Light Vessel. One of the men stationed aboard this vessel
gave us a “Merry Christmas” through a large megaphone.
Many of us had almost forgotten that this was the day before
Christmas; in fact, as later events proved, Christmas had very
little cheer for us.</p>

<p>Formby light was passed at 8.45, and Crosby Light 27
minutes later. We were now in the Mersey, our speed was
reduced and because of the shallowness of the water in the
river, men were placed in the chains to sound continually the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
depths of the water. We steamed up the river without mishap
and ran alongside the Princess Landing Stage, which because
of the heavy draft of the tide in this river, is a floating stage.
Our lines were thrown to the dock and made fast. No sooner
had this been accomplished than the gangway was thrown over
and the soldiers commenced disembarking. This continued
throughout the day.</p>

<p>Shortly after arriving news came to us of the sinking of
a British pilot boat, with the loss of all hands. This same
pilot boat had been mined in almost the same position that
we were lying in the night before, in fact many of us remembered
the boat as it was cruising around us, warning all outgoing
ships of the latest submarine activities. It was purely
a matter of luck that we had escaped a similar fate.</p>

at Liverpool, without plans, by Naval Constructor Alfred W.
Minuse, N. R., is the subject of a special article.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Liverpool</span></h3>

<p class="author">J. M.</p>

<p>The first liberty party from the <i>Leviathan</i> while in Liverpool,
left the ship at 4.30 P.&nbsp;M. on December 24th, and was
due back at noon on the 25th, which was Christmas, and it
turned out to be a gloomy, cheerless Christmas, for most of
the boys had never been away from home on that sacred day
before. Their first impression of the city was a poor one—dimly-lighted
streets, cold rain, dark alleys, and foggy river.
Dismal, indeed, after leaving a land of sunshine and bright
lights and coming to a land mostly of darkness and rain. The
sun did not rise during this time of the year until nearly 9
o’clock, at least that was the time that it was supposed to rise,
but it was seldom that we had the pleasure of seeing it even
for a full hour. Sunset was at 3.30 P.&nbsp;M., or in the vicinity,
so it will be seen that the days were real short during this
season. To think that we were to spend two months or more
in this country! We certainly were sorry for the men who
were stationed there and we would not change places with them
for a Navy clothing contract. The city appeared remarkably
true to type and character described by Conan Doyle in his
books. Without a doubt our impression would have been much
better if we had been there in time of peace. We did not realize
the trials that England had been through in the years before
we entered the war. Her best men had gone to fight and her
streets had to be kept dark because of air raids. Then there
was a food problem. The German U-boats sunk everything
possible that came within the range of a torpedo or a gun, so it
may be seen that England depended mostly on her ships to
bring food to her brave people and armies. When our crew
went ashore it was with great dismay that they viewed the food
problem—a meat card, a bread card, a tea card, a butter card,
were all necessary for a fellow to get a meal, and what was
worst of all, there was no sugar for our coffee and not being
tea drinkers we were very much grieved to find out that we
must use a chemical called saccharine to sweeten our coffee.
However, we soon got used to it, but whenever possible we
stayed on the ship for meals to make sure of things. It may
be mentioned that at the time there was no American Y. M.
C. A. in Liverpool. The English “Y” was as bad as the restaurants
as far as eating was concerned. The English mode
of travel was another puzzle to the American Bluejacket, there
being three different class distinctions. It seemed queer to an
Englishman that an American sailor should ride in a first
class compartment on a train supposed to be only for the
“higher class” people. It took our bluejackets quite some time
and cost a few black eyes and bumped noses to convince some
Englishmen that an American would not stand for any inferior
rating.</p>

<p>The English money was not such a puzzle as we had expected
to find it. In a few days and with the loss of a few
dollars in short change we soon learned to count it. We even
have reason to believe that during our first few liberties ashore
we actually received full value for our money in some instances.
One of the many questions asked us on our return was: How
and what are the English girls like? Gee! what a question to
deal with. Well, here goes for a hard try to be fair in all
cases. We found that most English girls are not stuck up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
are always willing to speak to a “gob” if he so desired. They
are more masculine than our girls. Girls run after a car and
hop on it while it is going at a good speed, and as far as good
looks are concerned there are pretty girls and then there are
others—of course this may be found the world over and in any
country. The streets of the city were, for the most part, narrow
and nearly always muddy and if a fellow came back to the ship
without wet feet it was something unusual. There were shows
of different kinds: vaudeville, drama, and musical comedy, not
forgetting the movies and Charlie Chaplin. The shows helped
to fill up a great lot of our time.</p>

<p>We were not at all sorry when we were told that we were
to leave in a few days, as all the necessary work had been
finished. The ship had been camouflaged in a most queer
design by English experts, which made it appear more grotesque
than ever.</p>

<p>The camouflage design was so perfect that when the
destroyer convoy met us at sea it was necessary for them to approach
us in the shape of a fan to make sure as to the direction
we were going. Many persons have been misled as to the real
use of camouflage on ships. Contrary to most beliefs it is
not to make a ship absolutely invisible to a submarine, but to
deceive the eye of the periscope in the submarine. A ship
is disguised so that from a distance it appears to be going in
an opposite direction, or on an angle to the real course
traveled.</p>

<p>On Lincoln’s Birthday the <i>Leviathan</i> left Liverpool. We
had gone through a rough vigil. If one were to ask us what
it was we liked best in Liverpool we would have answered,
“The first ship back to the states,” for Liverpool, with its bleak,
dimly-lighted streets and the piercing, foggy atmosphere was
no attraction.</p>

<p>We were in a heavy sea practically from the time we left
the Mersey until within a day or two of New York.</p>

<p>One interesting event occurred soon after our departure.
The <i>Porter</i>, one of the crackerjack destroyers, sighted a suspicious
spar in the water. With an abrupt change of course,
and almost turning in her own length, she made direct for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
object, dropping a 300-pound depth charge of T. N. T., which
blew the spar to atoms. At this time the crew was down
“chowing,” enjoying the famous <i>Leviathan</i> “turnovers.” The
explosion of this charge shook the ship and all hands rushed
on deck.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">High Seas</span></h3>

<p>The violent seas broke over our fo’castle, throwing the
spray as high as the flying bridge, 100 feet above the water. It
tore gun rails apart, lifted lifeboats from their fastenings,
opened shell cases and did considerable all-around damage.
Some good came of it—the first division men found no reason
to wash down decks for some time to come.</p>

<p>The destroyers were unable to keep up with us, and it is
remarkable that they stayed with us as long as they did. The sea
proved too much for them. When caught in the trough formed
by two high waves, hardly more than the top of their stacks and
masts was discernible. They trailed behind us the entire next
day, within radio call, and turned back upon receiving word
from us that we were out of the danger zone. The danger from
submarines was rather slight when it is considered how difficult
a matter it would be for them to launch a torpedo accurately
in a heavy sea.</p>

<p>We continued upon our course without event until off the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Here we ran into a fog so
thick that it was impossible to see our bow from the bridge, and
every minute for eight hours of this day our steam fog whistle
blew steadily, warning all nearby ships of our approach.</p>

<p>Nantucket Lightship, the first indication of land, was reported
by one of the signal boys on the night of February 18th.
Montauk Point and Shinnecock Lights soon followed and the
next morning found us at the entrance to New York Harbor,
our first overseas trip successfully completed.</p>

<p>The ship was brought up the river to the dock in the
thickest fog seen for years. Capt. W. S. McLaughlin gauged
the turn nicely and Capt. W. J. Bernard had a tug stationed
at the end of Pier 4 to guide the <i>Leviathan</i> in by whistle
signal. It was a highly creditable performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Second Trip to Liverpool</i></h3>

<p>After a stay of thirteen days in New York, during which
time our supplies were replenished and minor repairs and alterations
were made, we steamed out of New York Harbor on
March 4th, for our second trip overseas. On board we had
8,242 troops, with the following organizations:</p>

<p>120th Field Artillery, 121st Field Artillery, 2nd Motor
Mechanics, 9th and 10th Brigades, 20th F. A., 5th Div. School;
Maj. Gen. J. T. Dickman. Accompanying us was H. B. Davison,
Chairman of the War Council, American Red Cross. After passing
out of the channel we dropped our Pilot at Sandy Hook and
once more set our course at 90 degrees headed due east. Fire
Island Light was passed abeam at 2.43 the same afternoon. We
were making a standard speed of 20 knots which was maintained
throughout the day while the weather remained clear and the sea
smooth. After sundown the ship was darkened with the exception
of a few blue lights, commonly known as battle lights, located
at the various watertight doors and at the stairways. For
two days following, the weather remained moderate with occasional
rain squalls and light northeast winds. From this time on
all of our watertight doors were kept closed while an army guard
kept constant watch on all doors to see that they were not tampered
with or opened. Abandon ships drills were held each day
and it may be mentioned that there was ample lifeboat equipment
for every soldier aboard. Each soldier was provided with
a lifebelt. On the afternoon of March 7th smoke was sighted
dead ahead, we discovered it was a British cruiser and a half
hour later we passed her, on our starboard beam 15,000 yards
distant. On this same day a soldier on board was placed in
solitary confinement for making seditious remarks.</p>

<p>At 6.15 A.&nbsp;M., March 9th, the following radio message,
which was sent broadcast to all ships, was received:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Vessels may meet three Allied submarines now proceeding
from New London to Bermuda. Not escorted at present.”</p>

</div>

<p>We entered the War Zone on the eight to twelve watch on
the morning of March 11th, picking up our escort of destroyers,
seven in number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The rendezvous is previously arranged by cable and the
destroyers are picked up by wireless from 24 to 36 hours
before meeting. The times of arrival at the rendezvous are
exchanged, and the meeting place arranged.</p>

<p>After picking up our escort, of which the Destroyer
<i>Manly</i> was the senior ship, we proceeded on a zigzag course
heading again for Liverpool. While passing through St.
George’s Channel the <i>Manly</i> was seen to suddenly swerve out
of the formation and while only 800 yards from our port
bow she commenced firing with her forward battery and fired
a five-inch shell apparently at some suspicious object sighted.
She immediately dropped a depth charge. It was so close that
the <i>Leviathan</i> shook from stem to stern and many thought that
we had struck a mine. What the object was we do not know,
but if it was a sub, we extend our most heartfelt sympathies
to the families of the crew. We proceeded on our trip without
further event and the following afternoon found us in Liverpool
once more. Immediately upon arriving the disembarking
of troops and baggage was begun. The next morning,
before all troops had left the ship, it was necessary for us to
proceed to dry dock while the tide was high. One of the river
ferry-boats unfortunately passed too close to us and suffered
considerable damage, although she had been properly warned
to give us right of way.</p>

<p>Safely moored in Gladstone Dock this same afternoon,
the disembarking of troops was continued and completed the
next morning. It was fine to see regiments of American troops,
with flags unfurled and bands playing popular Yankee airs,
marching to war. The boys aroused the admiration of the
English.</p>

<p>Our stay in Liverpool, from March 12th to April 10th,
was similar to the previous one. Minor repairs were made and
our troop-carrying capacity was increased.</p>

<p>English contractors had been coaling the ship for at least
three weeks and a few days before sailing it was found necessary
for the crew to take this work in hand. The men worked
faithfully, night and day, for each additional ton placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the bunkers brought them so much closer to America—“God’s
Country.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Prisoners</span></h3>

<p>On April 9th, thirty-seven German prisoners, captured by
the destroyers <i>Fanning</i> and <i>Nicholson</i> when they bombed and
sank the U-58, were brought on board under guard for transportation
to the United States. These prisoners consisted of
thirty-three enlisted men, one warrant officer, and three commissioned
officers. They were young men, their senior officer
had been awarded the Iron Cross.</p>

<p>Previous to their arrival arrangements had been made by
the ship to guard them on the trip over. Twelve shot-guns of
English make were purchased ashore and sawed off by the
ship’s armorer to make them more effective for this sort of
work. The aft brig was put in readiness for the enlisted
prisoners, while staterooms on “C” deck were set aside for
the officers. Chief petty officers were detailed to guard the
officers on the trip over, while the guarding of the enlisted men
was taken care of by the regular ship’s guard. Each prisoner
wore a patch of red cloth on his right leg to signify that he
was a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>The C. P. O.’s guarding the prisoners had been torpedoed
by a submarine a short time previous and bore no great love
for their charges.</p>

<p>It was quite a jolt to their high pride to be captured by
the “Yanks” and sent home by the “Yanks” on a German ship
taken over by the “Yanks,” but the enlisted men seemed pleased
that they had been captured and their lives were at least safe.
Incidentally they showed no good feelings toward their former
officers. One of the men, a machinist, had formerly been a
bartender in Boston and one of the officers had been engaged
in business in Cincinnati some years prior to the war.</p>

<p>The officers were a dignified set and they seemed surprised
that they were not given unusual consideration. For
instance, one of them asked his guard why he did not have
hot water in his room. He was not highly elated when the
guard retorted, “You people built the ship, why didn’t you
pipe it to suit yourselves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The German officers dined in the Ritz-Carlton Mess Hall,
where our own officers dined, but at a table set aside for them
and under guard.</p>

<p>On April 13th, while en route to New York, we fired flat
nose shells from each gun for tests. The German prisoners
below thought we were firing at another of their “subs” and
were much excited. The prisoners showed much interest as
to what arrangements had been made for their abandoning
ship, if occasion required, and did not seem any too pleased
when they were informed that the same arrangements had been
made for them as they had made for the lost souls on the
<i>Lusitania</i>. Of course this was not literally true.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned that their first meal aboard this
ship consisted of a favorite dish, frankfurters and sauerkraut.
This was not pre-arranged, but incidentally happened to be
on the menu that night.</p>

<p>The trip home was without further event, except for a
small iceberg sighted the second day out. We arrived in
Hoboken on the afternoon of the 17th, and were welcomed by
the usual crowds that lined the docks. The German submarine
prisoners were taken off and placed under marine
guard, and thence sent down to Fort McPherson, Ga.</p>

<p>The German officers moved off with disdain but their enlisted
men waved a cordial good-bye to the ship and her crew.
This incident illustrated their phase of mind, finally culminating
in the mutinies of the German sailors at Kiel and Wilhelmshafen
and effectually prevented a clashing of the German fleet
and the Allied Navy.</p>

<h3><i>Third Trip Overseas</i></h3>

<p>Late in the afternoon of April 24th, the <i>Leviathan</i> cast
off her lines once more, after a short stay of only seven days
in Hoboken. The patent log, which registers the speed of the
ship, was streamed from the taff-rail upon our departure and
a standard speed of eighteen knots was maintained until past
Ambrose Channel Light Vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Troops and organizations on board were as follows:</p>

<p>Troops, 8,909. Men in 11th Infantry; 15th Machine Gun
Battalion; Base Hospital No. 20, Female; Base Hospital No.
30, Female; 304th Field Artillery; 306th Field Artillery;
302d Supply Train of the 77th Div. N. A.; Brig. General Walter
H. Gordon, 10th Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>Exceptionally mild weather was encountered on the entire
trip across, especially in the Gulf Stream, the temperature of
the water at times running as high as 73 degrees. Numerous
flying-fish and schools of Porpoise were observed from
day to day. The spouting fish would cause us to keep our
gaze fixed upon him. Gliding through the water he greatly
resembles the wake of a periscope.</p>

<p>The opinion was expressed on board that this time France
would be our destination. Our cargo holds were loaded to
the top with all sorts of army equipment, camouflaged artillery
wagons, automobile trucks, shell cases, etc. After the fourth
day out the men on the bridge knew for an absolute fact, by
the course steered, that we were heading for France and many
of us already saw ourselves walking up the main street of
Paris with a girl on each arm. Little did we know how keen
our disappointment would be, for as later events proved, our
views of France were to be observed from a coal barge,
three long miles away from the mainland.</p>

<p>Occasionally a convoy of perhaps ten or twelve vessels
would be sighted, hull below the horizon and just the masts
visible, presenting a peculiar sight, keeping pace with us for
a few hours and gradually disappearing. It was unusual for
a lone ship to be sighted, for the safest method of travel was
in convoy, escorted by cruisers or destroyers. Extremely precautionary
methods were always taken with ships sighted without
escort, a change of course usually effected to give such
vessels a wide berth. They were always looked upon with
suspicion by us, especially sailing vessels, for instances have
been reported of German U-boats rigging up two or three
sails and floating on the surface of the water to resemble
harmless, slow-moving schooners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Precautions Taken</span></h3>

<p>In addition to these we gave wide berth to any floating
objects observed, such as barrels, spars, wooden cases, etc., for
fear that these were dangerous mines. On one occasion, while in
the danger zone, our starboard guns were fired on a suspicious
object which later proved to be a spouting black-fish.
Absolutely no chances were taken. Our motto, because of the
12,000 souls aboard, was “Safety First.” A transport, especially
one nearly 1,000 feet long, presents a huge target for a
U-boat, and must necessarily act on the defensive, not offensive.</p>

<p>Everything went well on this journey until very close to
land. We were escorted by the usual destroyers and were
prepared to make land fall, when the good weather we had
been having was interrupted by an extremely heavy fog. Although
still in the danger zone our speed was necessarily decreased.
It is almost impossible to navigate in a thick fog
and consequently our engines were brought almost to a standstill.
Looking out on our starboard beam, through the thick
fog, an object was seen to approach us. This proved to be one
of our destroyers, which hove close to. Through a megaphone
an officer on our bridge shouted, “We don’t know where
we are. Do you?” To which came the most disappointing
answer, “No.” Here was a ticklish situation. Floundering
around in a section of water that was a hot-bed for submarines,
we were all considerably on the alert. Suddenly through the
thick fog, from the destroyer, came the report, “Black and white
buoy on starboard beam.” All breathed a sigh of relief, for
that buoy signified mid-channel and that we were following
a course that would lead us direct to our destination. This
was a bit of clever navigation, even if we say so ourselves.</p>

<p>We entered the harbor of Brest, France, on the afternoon
of May 2d, just as the fog lifted. Our eyes beheld a beautiful
harbor, surrounded on the mainland by the prettiest green
fields and old-fashioned farm-houses, with a clear sky overhead
and a hot sun beating down on the deep, blue water of
the Goulet. Our mooring was made to a large buoy, for in
Brest there are very few docks and none large enough for a
ship of our dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Hastily the disembarkation of troops and cargo was
begun and simultaneously the crew turned to on the coal
barges with a will, shovelling 4,600 tons of coal in the ship’s
bunkers within 48 hours.</p>

<p>The colored men from the stevedore regiments stationed
at Brest, assisted materially in this work, coaling from barges
on the starboard side of the ship, while two regimental bands
retained on board to entertain the men filled the air with the
latest “jazz” band music.</p>

<p>We were soon under way again leaving Brest on the evening
of May 5th, bound for New York.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Brest</span></h3>

<p>Brest is a seaport in the northwest of France, department
of Finisterre. It has one of the best harbors in France and is
the chief station of the French marine having safe roads capable
of containing 500 men-of-war in from eight to fifteen
fathoms at low water. The entrance is narrow and rocky and
the coast on both sides is well fortified. The design to make
it a naval arsenal originated with Richelieu and was carried
out by Duquesne and Vauban in the reign of Louis XIV, with
the result that the town was made almost impregnable. Brest
stands on the summit and sides of a projecting ridge, many
of the streets being exceedingly steep. Several of the docks
have been cut in the solid rock, and a breakwater extends far
into the roadstead. The manufactures of Brest are inconsiderable,
but it has an extensive trade in cereals, wine, brandy,
sardines, mackerel, and colonial goods. It is connected with
America by a cable terminating near Duxbury, Mass.</p>

<p>The English and Dutch were repulsed at Brest in 1694.
In 1794 it was blockaded by Howe, who won a great victory
off the coast over the French fleet.</p>

<p>Our escort of destroyers remained with us until the
following morning, May 6th, seeing us safely through the
war zone. The remainder of our voyage was accomplished
at a speed of twenty knots without event of importance until
arriving off Ambrose Light, the entrance to New York Harbor.
Here a thick fog again delayed us, causing us to drop anchor
until late in the afternoon of the same day, May 12th. The
sky cleared about this time and we proceeded up the channel
and to our regularly assigned berth, making fast to the dock
in Hoboken at 9:28 P.&nbsp;M.</p>

<p>When the members of the crew went ashore they were
subjected to excited cross-examination by many people, for
rumor had decreed that we had been torpedoed and sunk
with a tremendous loss of life. Of course we were not permitted
to divulge any information along this line, but it was
amusing to hear what interesting stories were narrated by the
home-folk and it was with much satisfaction that we assured
them, after the manner of Mark Twain, that the report of our
deaths had been very much exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Fourth Overseas Trip</i></h3>

<p>The ship remained at her berth in Hoboken from the 12th
to the 22d of May, giving the crew a reasonable amount of
shore leave, the men living in nearby states thus had an opportunity
to visit their homes.</p>

<p>At 4:03 on the afternoon of May 22d, we left on our
fourth eastward bound voyage with the following troops:</p>

<p>Troops, 10,577. 43rd Engineers; 108th Supply Train;
131st Infantry; 318th Infantry; Base Hospital No. 13, Female;
Major General A. Gronkhite, 80th Div.</p>

<p>We followed the regular channel in leaving New York
Harbor, and once more at sea, started on our fourth venture
to slip through the blockade of German U-boats and to land
10,000 more troops to assist in breaking down the high pride
of the German autocracy.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of May 23d, at 4 P.&nbsp;M., while the
water-tight door system was being tested, one of the Army
officers accidentally had his leg caught in a closing water-tight
door. These doors are hydraulically opened and shut and
centrally controlled by a lever on the bridge. Prior to the
closing of these doors a warning alarm is sounded, but the
officer, in some unexplainable manner, became confused and
suffered a severe injury.</p>

<p>The ship’s log for the next few days showed the single
entry “B,” which signifies clear weather and absolutely blue
sky. The sea was unusually smooth at this time, hardly a
ripple appearing on the surface of the water.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“Carlton” Torpedoed</span></h3>

<p>At 6:37 A.&nbsp;M., May 29th, our escort of destroyers was
picked up, immediately taking up their respective positions
abeam and ahead of the ship. Everything went well until
4:25 this same afternoon, when we received an S.O.S. from the
<i>U. S. S. Carlton</i> that she had been torpedoed in 47° North Latitude,
11° 20´´ West Longitude, and upon referring to our
charts we found that we would be in that same position at
9:30 that same evening. It was advisable for us to change our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
course in order to steer clear of the possible cruising radius
of this submarine, which we did at 5:05, heading our course
to the north. At 10:45 P.&nbsp;M., after passing the approximate
position of the sinking of the <i>Carlton</i>, we resumed our
direct course for Brest. During this time signals were exchanged
between us and our escort upon the advisability of
sending one of our escorting destroyers to the assistance of
the <i>Carlton</i>, but owing to the great value of our own ship and
its precious cargo aboard this was deemed inadvisable. This
illustrates what stern measures necessarily had to be taken in
time of war. We were compelled to leave the crew of a torpedoed
ship presumably to their fate for the greater duty
involved upon us. However, later reports showed that the
crew of the <i>Carlton</i> had been rescued by one of the alert
destroyers patrolling the seas in this vicinity.</p>

<p>We did not consider all danger past and as an extra precaution,
orders were issued on board to have all men assigned
to duty on life-boats and similar duties, remain at their stations
until further orders. This vigil continued throughout the night.
It was a clear moonlight night, but moonlight held no charm
for us then. The rays reflecting upon the water lighted up
the huge ship and made her a fine target for a lurking U-boat.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Engagement with Submarine</span></h3>

<p>Communication made with Brest the next morning, May
30th, informed us that the pilot and pilot destroyer would meet
us. However, for a very good reason we did not pick up a
pilot, for on this date, which has proven memorable in the
history of the <i>Leviathan</i>, “Fritz” did his best to make it a
Memorial Day for the <i>Leviathan</i> and a Decoration Day
for himself. On the spot that we expected to take our
pilot on board we had our first real engagement with the
pirates of the sea. With the hills of Brest plainly visible on
our port bow, the smooth surface of the water was broken by
the wake of a periscope on our port quarter. The sharp eyes of
Lieutenant Beebe, the assistant navigator, saw the danger, and
from his post of observation he reported sharply to the captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Captain Bryan was at his side in an instant and—saw—nothing.
The “sub” had “porpoised” under. The young navigator stayed
glued to the spot. The “sub” porpoised up on the surface and
this time the captain was looking over the shoulder of the former
blue-jacket, and in an instant things began to hum. The following
entry was made in the ship’s log:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>12:29 P.&nbsp;M.—Sighted submarine pursuing us on our port
quarter, about 1,500 yards distant. Ordered full speed, 165 revolutions.
Opened fire with Number Six and Number Eight guns,
three shots. Stopped zig-zagging. Changed course 12:40 P.&nbsp;M.</p>

<p>12:59 P.&nbsp;M.—Submarine appeared again. Opened fire with
Number Six and Number Eight guns. Nine shots.</p>

<p>1:19 P.&nbsp;M.—Submarine appeared again. Opened fire with
Number Six and Number Eight guns. Seven shots.</p>

<p>1:34 P.&nbsp;M.—Threw in manœuvering combination. Standard
speed 112 revolutions.</p>

<p>1:45 P.&nbsp;M.—Entering harbor at various courses and
speeds.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the general opinion among the officers on board
that a cordon of U-boats had been lying in wait, located in
such a manner that if the first submarine failed in her attempt
to torpedo us, the others in turn would be in a position to
follow up the attack.</p>

<p>During one attack a French fishing boat appeared between
us and our object of fire, and had a very narrow escape from
being struck by one of our 105 pound explosive shells. The
skipper of this boat was taken on board later. He said he
clearly saw the “sub” we were firing at.</p>

<p>The coolness of our commanding officer, Capt. H. F.
Bryan, and the splendid co-ordination of the entire crew,
were so perfect, that only three distinct orders were issued in
this moment of peril, as follows: 1. Hold your course. 2. Open
fire on submarine, port quarter. 3. Sound General Alarm.</p>

<p>Every shot fired was greeted by cheers and shouts of encouragement
from the enthusiastic soldiers on the decks, who
crowded to favorable positions to witness the accurate firing
of our gun-crews. The Army Nurses left their luncheon to
take a peek at the “fun,” and their calmness and enthusiasm
in the face of a deadly menace were an inspiration to the sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
manning the big guns. An apt comparison to this battle would
be the excitement incidental to a World Series baseball game,
eleven innings, score: 0-0, and a home-run hit made. Wow!</p>

<p>After the attack no evidence was noted of any of the
“subs” having been sunk, such as oil or scum or floating bits
of wreckage. Of course, we did not turn around or stop to
look for this evidence, but inasmuch as none of the enemy was
allowed within torpedo range or cared to show himself again,
he certainly must have taken the accuracy of our gun-fire into
serious consideration.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of our freedom of the press was typically
demonstrated in the U. S. at this time, for the leading newspapers
contained all sorts of misleading accounts, full of far-fetched
descriptions of the attack. One paper stated that
twenty U-boats had attacked the <i>Leviathan</i> and that we had
evaded a school of torpedoes. The exact number of submarines
encountered on this day is not known, but it is believed that
there were at least three, and very probably more.</p>

<p>We had a narrow escape though, for just after the first
submarine was sighted, at 12:29 mid-day, our zigzag clock
on the bridge rang, 12:30, notifying us to make an abrupt
change of course to port. If this change had been made the
“sub” would have had us broadside on and our entire length
would have been exposed to torpedo attack. Captain Bryan saw
this immediately and issued the above-mentioned order to hold
the course.</p>

<p>Arriving in Brest after all this excitement the ship was
made fast to our usual mooring buoy. The crew as before,
turned to on the coal barges and inspired by the enthusiasm
and excitement and experience of that morning, heaved the
necessary amount of coal, 4,500 tons, into the bunkers in
record time. The big ship had discharged its living cargo of
thousands of troops, hundreds of officers and many passengers,
had sent loads of stores to the grim destroyers, including
thousands of bags of welcome mail from the folks at home
and then proceeded to sea inspired with the hopes and desires of
clashing with the submarine that had sunk the <i>President Lincoln</i>
the day before. “Up and at ’em” was our slogan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Second Submarine Fight</span></h3>

<p>We sailed out of Brest late in the afternoon of June 1st,
having on board many notable passengers. The destroyers
<i>Nicholson</i> and <i>Wadsworth</i>, two of our most famous sea-fighters,
accompanied us. All hands were set for another attack. It
was not long in coming. At 7:16 P.&nbsp;M. this same evening, the
wake of a periscope was observed on the starboard quarter by
Lieutenant Haltnorth, who quickly passed the word to the
bridge where it was received by Lieutenant J. J. Jones, the
Officer of the deck. A hurried message was sent in to the
commanding Officer and at the same time the general alarm
was sounded. The fire-control officer on the upper-structure
took a prompt and accurate range on the hissing white menace
of foam approaching so balefully in the wake of the setting
sun. A few short seconds passed, the arrow on the engine
room dial plate spun around to “full speed ahead,” and the
whirr of the electric warnings quickened the ears of the officers
and men on watch in the fire-rooms. The furnace doors flew
open and in the streaming light with bent backs and broad
shoulders, sturdy young Americans poured coal into the great
fires.</p>

<p>A volume of thick black smoke issued from the funnels
and at the same time number seven gun with a venomous roar,
let go a shell of TNT, enveloped in lurid flame and smoke.
Number five gun got busy. The breech-plug closed noiselessly,
sharp click, the primer inserted accurately by the gun-captain,
a smooth “Ready” from his lips, and number five gun hurled
a shell of high explosive to blot out from the sea-scape one of
the under-sea Hun boats.</p>

<p>Number seven gun shot again with a reverberating roar,
followed again by number five, the only two guns that could
bear upon the Prussian menace.</p>

<p>From the signal-bridge, a green and white submarine
warning flag was fluttering and the destroyers <i>Nicholson</i> and
<i>Wadsworth</i>, with their inboard sides awash, turned in a quick
endeavor to charge the on-coming “sub.” The <i>Nicholson</i>
was nearer and in few minutes number five and seven guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ceased firing, for the <i>Nicholson</i> was in direct range between
our ship and the submarine, with huge volumes of black smoke
pouring out of her funnels. The <i>Nicholson</i> made a circuit
around the “sub” which had submerged and promptly and
accurately laid a beautiful barrage of sixteen depth bombs
all around the place of disappearance. The explosions
from these depth charges shook the big <i>Leviathan</i>, nearly two
miles away by this time. The <i>Nicholson</i>, her blinker lights
flashing fitfully through the smoke clouds reported, “We saw
periscope of submarine and laid barrage of depth charges
around the spot. We will report to our Force Commander.”</p>

<p>The <i>Wadsworth</i> had by this time plowed her way up
through the seas, but the Prussian terror of the deep had not
taken too kindly to the overtures of friendship made by the
<i>Nicholson</i>; and the <i>Wadsworth</i> signaled back to the <i>Leviathan</i>,
“We see no submarine now.” Both gallant destroyers quickly
turned and resumed their arduous duty of escorting the fast-moving
<i>Leviathan</i>. Smoke was pouring from their funnels and
a choppy sea made them bob up and down. A cloud of “V”
shaped spray sparkled in the twilight as they circled in and out
off the port and starboard bow of the queen of the transports.</p>

<p>Twilight in the western sky deepened into long shadows
upon the water. The chaplain of the ship walked out to the
windward side of the navigation bridge and offered the customary
sunset prayer for the huge ship with its women and
children passengers, its captain, officers and crew. This custom
of evening prayer was practiced on board every evening
at sunset and prefaced the silent evening prayers of the seamen
on the decks, the gun-crew at the guns, the signal boys on
the bridge, the quartermaster at the wheel and the brawny-chested
firemen who stoked the big furnaces below. In the
war-zone none of these brave lads were certain of seeing
another sunrise, so before the ship was plunged into darkness
each night they offered up, while at their different duties and
stations, heartfelt prayers for themselves and their people and
loved ones at home.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>The Sunset Prayer at Sea</h3>

<p class="author">(Offered Every Evening at Sea by the Ship’s Chaplain)</p>

<p>Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and Thine holy name
is called upon by us; leave us not, O Lord our God.</p>

<p>O Lord, hear our prayer; and let our cry come unto Thee.</p>

<p>Remember, most gracious Virgin Mother, Star of the Sea,
that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection,
implored thy aid and sought thy intercession, was left unaided.
Inspired with this confidence, we fly to thee, Virgin of Virgins,
our Mother, to thee we come; before thee we stand, sinful and
sorrowful. Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our
petition; but in thy clemency hear and answer us. Amen.</p>

<p>Lord, save us waking, watch us sleeping that we may
wake with Christ and rest in peace.</p>

<p>Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our distant homes and
families; Thine angels guard them with Thy peace and benediction.
Bless this ship we beseech Thee and drive far from it all
the snares of the enemy; guide it upon a tranquil course unto
the wished-for-haven—guard our Captain, his officers and crew,
and the soldier-troops and passengers committed to their care;
let Thy holy angels dwell hereon to keep us in peace and let Thy
blessings be always upon us. Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son,
Our Lord.</p>

<p>Into Thy hands, O Lord, we commend ourselves.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe, O Lord, this night to keep us without harm.</p>

<p>May the Lord Almighty grant us a quiet night and a perfect
end. May the Almighty and merciful Lord, the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost bless and preserve us all. Amen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship pursued her course steadily during the night
watches and the men relieved one another at midnight and
at 4 A.&nbsp;M. The morning sun broke clear and clean over the
eastern horizon and discovered to us that our gallant destroyers
had left us during the darkness, proceeding by pre-arranged
plan to a similar duty of escorting an east-bound transport
loaded with troops. Our voyage continued without further
excitement at a speed of twenty and a half knots. We arrived
in New York the morning of June 8th and made fast to the
dock with little difficulty. No sooner had our gangplank
touched the dock than our mail clerk was seen heavily laden
with eagerly-sought-for mail.</p>

<h3><i>Fifth Trip Overseas</i></h3>

<p>Eight days was ample time to give half the crew a five-day
leave, and five days’ leave gave many of the boys who
lived within traveling distance of New York, an opportunity
to see home again for a few days. It was at this time that the
one-third fare rate was put into effect for soldiers and sailors
on furlough and it is needless to say this greatly assisted
many boys who did not have the full fare to reach home.</p>

<p>By evening, June 14th, all necessary supplies were
loaded in our holds. Our quota of troops, this trip were
as per the following list:</p>

<p>Troops, 10,423; 32d Engineers; 145th Infantry; 146th
Infantry; 134th Machine Gun Battalion; 135th Machine Gun
Battalion; Major General C. S. Farnsworth.</p>

<p>For thirty-six hours after leaving Ambrose Channel Light
Ship, just outside of New York, we were escorted by one
destroyer, submarines were busily engaged off our coast-line
these days. After the destroyer left us we continued on our
voyage in the customary manner, holding abandon ship drills
each day and operating the water-tight door system to insure
its being in perfect working order. The weather was extremely
warm and as a consequence it was found necessary to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the soldiers from the lower compartments to sleep on the
outer decks.</p>

<p>On the 17th, at ten minutes to eleven in the morning,
the <i>Leviathan</i> acted queerly, circling around in the smooth sea,
which aroused the curiosity of all on board. This circling was
caused by the steering apparatus going out of commission, but
it was soon repaired.</p>

<p>We certainly expected to see more of “Fritz” than ever
on this voyage, but not a solitary event occurred outside the
daily routine. Brest, France, was reached on the morning of
the 21st, troops and cargo were disembarked and we headed
for sea once more on the 24th accompanied by four destroyers.</p>

<p>The return trip was interrupted once. The destroyers
had left us after a day’s journey and no sooner had they done
so when our gun-crews opened fire on a suspicious object
astern of us. The destroyers by this time were on the horizon
and hearing the firing of our guns proceeded to join us once
more. Both number five and seven guns fired nine shots at
the object sighted which disappeared immediately and we
signaled to our destroyers that everything was O. K. and that
we could proceed once more unescorted.</p>

<p>The weather for the remainder of the voyage was excellent.
Fire Island Light Ship, which is thirty-two miles from
Ambrose Channel, was sighted July 1st and in a few hours we
were tied up at our pier in Hoboken with another trip to our
credit.</p>

<h3><i>Sixth Trip Eastbound</i></h3>

<p>Another eight days in New York and another five-day
leave for the men of the crew. The five-day leaves were most
welcome after a trip of seventeen or eighteen days at sea especially
when the days consist of vigilant activity and high tension.
The five days soon passed and as soon as we were provided
with sufficient supplies of coal and water our troops came
aboard.</p>

<p>Troops, 10,534; 313th Infantry; 314th Infantry; 311th
Machine Gun Battalion; 310th Machine Gun Battalion; Base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Hospital No. 67; Base Hospital No. 68; Base Hospital No. 7;
Base Hospital No. 47; 304th Field Signal Battalion; Brig.
General Wm. J. Nicholson, 79th Div.</p>

<p>We left for our sixth voyage across on July 8th at 6:30
P.&nbsp;M., and by nightfall we were well out to sea escorted by the
destroyer <i>Walke</i> which left us the next morning. On the eight
to twelve watch that morning we passed a considerable amount
of wreckage, probably the result of submarine activities off
our coast. Abandon ship drills were held as usual. The
weather was fair and warm and a few soldiers were overcome
by the heat making it necessary for the troops in some
compartments to sleep on deck at night.</p>

<p>The <i>U. S. S. Covington</i> had been sunk by an unseen submarine
just prior to our sailing, and with this fresh in our
memory it was not necessary to remind the lookouts and gun
crews to be especially vigilant and keep a sharp lookout at all
times. We sighted our escort of destroyers at 8 A.&nbsp;M., on
July 14th and passing through the danger zone safely, we
anchored in Brest at 1:50 P.&nbsp;M., July 15th, one of the hottest
days we had ever experienced.</p>

<p>With all troops sent ashore and all cargo taken off we
embarked our usual quota of passengers and left Brest at
three o’clock on the afternoon of July 18th. We had 115
wounded soldiers on board, also the captain and officers of the
<i>U. S. S. Covington</i> and the officers and crew of the <i>S. S.
Buffalo</i> that had been sunk by submarines. We left with a
convoy of four destroyers that stayed with us until noon the
next day. The weather was good for the most part and the trip
was made without trouble or excitement of any kind. The
wounded soldiers were a cheerful lot and were well cared for.
Some had been gassed, others lost limbs, but the prospect of
home made them all happy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">McGonigle</span></h3>

<p>Among our wounded soldiers was a man named McGonigle
who had made the first overseas trip with the first batch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
troops the <i>Leviathan</i> carried across. We landed them in Liverpool.</p>

<p>McGonigle belonged to a bombing squad and was wounded.
His squad was in a shell hole hurling bombs into the enemy
trenches for thirty-six hours. The men were tired and hungry.
The Sergeant in charge was giving instructions to the men
when a bomb held in the hands of McGonigle exploded blowing
off both of his hands and inflicting other minor wounds including
the amputation of the great toe of his left foot. Four of
his comrades, including the sergeant, were killed by this explosion.</p>

<p>During our westbound trip an entertainment was given
for the benefit of the wounded. During a lull between acts
McGonigle stood up, and holding up both remaining parts of
his arms said he would give a short stump speech. He then
told of his accident and was glad to be going back on the ship
that took him over, and on which ship he, with sixty other
members of his company had volunteered to help the firemen
in the fire room. He said he was one of us, a “gob,” for
he had helped “deliver the goods.”</p>

<p>July 25th, at nine o’clock we passed Ambrose Light Ship
and by 11:30 we were tied to our pier.</p>

<h3><i>Seventh Voyage Overseas</i></h3>

<p>With the following troops and passengers on board we
left New York at 3:25 P.&nbsp;M., August 3rd:</p>

<p>Troops, 10,893; 55th Infantry; 56th Infantry; 20th Machine
Gun Battalion; 36th Div. Displacement Det.; 111th
Trench Motor Battery; 88th Div. School Det.; July Auto Replacement
Draft; Colonel W. O. Johnson, 56th Inf.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of the ship we now traveled
with other transports—the <i>Great Northern</i> and <i>Northern
Pacific</i>, sister ships from the Pacific coast. These could speed
along with us only in smooth water. In turbulent seas they
dropped rapidly astern. The <i>Great Northern</i> reached New
York one hour ahead of the <i>Leviathan</i> on one trip, but traveled
100 miles less to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>One of our latest destroyers accompanied the convoy for
the next twenty-four hours and then the three ships traveled unescorted,
in beam-to-beam formation. The weather remained
fair for the first four days during which time usual abandon
ship drills were held.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, however, we had some rough experiences.
A storm broke, the waves rolled high and beat the ships fiercely.
It was mid-summer and we were in the Gulf Stream yet the
storm was a “whopper.” To add to the excitement the <i>Northern
Pacific</i> reported “man overboard,” by a signal from her
bridge. Immediately all three ships went into manœuvering
formation and circled around the spot. The man overboard
was a soldier. It was suicide with him though, for he left a
letter of explanation. While circling around in an attempt
to pick him up another man from the <i>Northern Pacific</i> went
overboard. This was an unfortunate accident. Life buoys
were dropped into the high-rolling seas for the lost men,
and for an hour and a half we manœuvered around in an
attempt to pick these men up, but it was useless. No one
could stay afloat in that sea. The <i>Northern Pacific</i> and <i>Great
Northern</i> both reported that they could make little headway
and finally when the search for the missing men was given up
we found it necessary to reduce speed so that the other ships
in our convoy could remain in line with us.</p>

<p>The destroyers were picked up on the morning of August
10th and we passed through the war zone without trouble or
excitement and anchored in Brest at 10 A.&nbsp;M., August 11th.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours later we were steaming on our westbound
voyage again, the <i>Great Northern</i> and <i>Northern Pacific</i>
being with us. The weather was fine and we made good speed.
On the 14th, at 9 A.&nbsp;M., a submarine was sighted on our starboard
quarter between our ship and the Northern Pacific, but
it was not fired at, nor did it attempt to do any damage. It
might have been a submarine of the Allies. The destroyers
left us this same evening and with fair weather and smooth
seas, which were fully appreciated, we made Ambrose Channel
on August 20th and docked soon afterwards.</p>

<h3><i>Eighth Overseas Voyage</i></h3>

<p>The following is an extract copy of the readings in the
ship’s log upon our leaving New York for the eighth trip
overseas. This was on the 31st of August and for the second
time the transports <i>Great Northern</i> and <i>Northern Pacific</i> accompanied
us.</p>

<p>Upon our reaching Sandy Hook the pilot boat approached
and launched a small row boat which made for our gangway.
This boat came to get the pilot who had seen us safely through
the channel, and to take him to another ship coming into New
York. Pilot McLoughlin waved good-bye to the troops on board
and was cheered as he left.</p>

<p>Immediately before proceeding to sea the paravanes were
lowered over the ship’s side. The paravanes are ingenious
torpedo-shaped contrivances so constructed as to fend off from
the ship’s side dangerous floating objects such as mines. The
upper section of a paravane is equipped with a jaw-shaped
arrangement, so made as to clip the cable extending between
a mine and its anchor. The “P. V.’s,” as they are sometimes
called, are launched over the side from the forward part of
the vessel and while in the water are supported by a wire
cable from the deck of the ship and by a heavy chain extending
upward from the keel.</p>

<p>We were now fully set and ready for our voyage, the
<i>Great Northern</i> taking up a position on our starboard beam
and the <i>Northern Pacific</i> on our port beam. The three ships
in line presented a formidable appearance as they plowed
the smooth seas at a rate of twenty knots per hour. Zigzag
plans were communicated to the <i>Great Northern</i> and <i>Northern
Pacific</i> by the <i>Leviathan</i>, the senior ship, and from dawn to
dark on this day and every day thereafter until reaching port
all three ships, upon the ringing of the zigzag clock, sheered
off simultaneously, first to port, then to starboard, then to port
again, the zigzag pennant on our yard-arm dipping as each
change of course was made.</p>

<p>On September 2d, the Captain of the <i>Great Northern</i> signaled
to us that his aft gun crew had sighted the feather of a
periscope about two miles astern of us, which had disappeared
almost immediately and so no shots were fired at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days later, through signals exchanged between
ourselves and the <i>Great Northern</i>, we learned that we were
to lose Captain Bryan upon reaching New York, and that
Captain Phelps of the <i>Great Northern</i> was to be his successor.
Captain Bryan, we learned, was to take up a station somewhere
in Brazil.</p>

<p>Stormy weather hindered our progress on the fourth day
out. The seas were so heavy that both the <i>Great Northern</i> and
<i>Northern Pacific</i> found great difficulty in keeping up with us.
Finally, the <i>Northern Pacific</i> signaled to us that because of the
seas she could make little progress and asked that the standard
speed for the convoy be reduced to thirteen knots. This was
granted and for fourteen hours the three ships labored in the
heavy seas, spray breaking over the fo’castle and reaching to
our forward smoke-stack. Toward evening the sea moderated
sufficiently to allow the <i>Great Northern</i> and <i>Northern Pacific</i> to
increase speed to sixteen and a half knots and then to twenty
knots, until we picked up our escort of four destroyers at the
ocean rendezvous.</p>

<p>All seven ships proceeded to Brest by the shortest route
and in a fairly smooth sea. The <i>Leviathan</i> was shaken by an
extremely heavy explosion and its suddenness surprised the
men. The Chief Engineer reported everything O.K. down
below and as far as we could see on deck there was nothing
wrong with the ship; then the blinker light on the destroyer
<i>McDougal</i> directly abeam of us, was observed flashing a message
to us, which explained everything. The <i>McDougal</i> had
accidentally dropped a depth charge from her stern. It wasn’t
the first false alarm we had had and it was not to be the last.</p>

<p>Land was sighted on the afternoon of September 7th, and
swiftly and smoothly the three transports ran into column formation,
with the destroyers abeam and ahead of us, steaming
majestically into the harbor of Brest. Looking around after
mooring we saw the huge transport <i>Mt. Vernon</i>, formerly
the German liner <i>Kronprinzessin Cecilie</i>, lying in dry dock
after running a 250-mile race against threatened disaster.
She had been torpedoed at eight o’clock the morning before and
only the gallantry of her captain and crew, and the efficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
system of water-tight doors, enabled her to make port at a
speed of fifteen knots. It was indeed remarkable that we had
escaped seeing “subs” the day before, for our course was
almost identical with that of the <i>Mt. Vernon’s</i>. The <i>Mt.
Vernon</i> was repaired and thereafter made two round trips to
America and did its “bit” in bringing our soldier boys home.</p>

<p>To give the reader a fair idea of the ship’s routine on
entering Brest and while coaling in the harbor, we again quote
from the log of the ship:</p>

<p>The disembarkation of troops and cargo was completed
in short order and the <i>Leviathan</i> put to sea once more on the
12th of September. The bodies of thirty-six victims of the <i>Mt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Vernon</i> were on board, each body being draped with the flag
which they had heroically died for. These thirty-six victims
were trapped in the fire-room of the <i>Mt. Vernon</i> when the torpedo
struck her and they had no chance to escape before the
water filled the lower compartments. The loss of life would
not have been so great had not the ship been torpedoed at a
time when the fire-room watches were being relieved, for at
such time there are almost double the number of men in the
fire-rooms.</p>

<p>Our voyage back was interrupted but once. The <i>Great
Northern</i> on our starboard, on the 13th of September, reported
a periscope two miles astern of us and traveling to the southward.
It disappeared almost as quickly as the periscope
encountered on the eastern trip, and consequently no shots were
fired at it. A vigilant watch maintained by the lookouts was
without result, the submarine did not show itself again. On
the 19th of September we were safe in New York Harbor and
docked six minutes after the first line was ashore, a record
achievement in the log of the capable and efficient docking
superintendent, Capt. Walter J. Bernard.</p>

<h3><i>Ninth Overseas Trip</i></h3>

<p>We left our pier at Hoboken, September 29th and our
ninth voyage overseas was underway. The following troops
were on board:</p>

<p>Troops, 9,366; 57th Pioneer Infantry; September Auto
Replacements Drafts from Camps McArthur, Humphreys,
Hancock and Jackson; Medical Replacement, No. 73; 401st
Pontoon Train; 467th Pontoon Train; 468th Pontoon Train;
Water Tank Train No. 302; 323rd Field Signal Battalion;
Base Hospitals No. 60 and 62, Female; Debarking and Billet
Party 31st Div.; Major General Leroy S. Lyon, C. G. 31st Div.</p>

<p>Under clear skies we steamed slowly through the big
harbor filled with shipping and proceeded straight to sea,
stopping only to drop our pilot, Capt. McLaughlin, of the Sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Hook Pilot Association and who always piloted the <i>Leviathan</i>
in and out of New York Harbor. This trip overseas was
to be made memorable by reason of the Army epidemic
of influenza on board. Many men and several nurses were
obliged to leave the ship just before we cast off our lines
and everyone felt that we would have a distressing time going
over. While the embarkation troops were lined up on the big
pier some of the men dropped helpless on the dock. We were
informed that a number of men had fallen by the wayside, limp
and listless, on their march from the camp to the scene of
transportation. Our first death was recorded the next day out.
He was a sailor who did duty in the Hospital Corps. He told
the chaplain that he did not want to die because of the great
need of his help at home. Out of over two thousand cases of
influenza and pneumonia on board, this first case and two naval
passengers en route to duty in France, were the only ones to die
from the Navy. All the other deaths belonged to the Army,
96 in all.</p>

<p>This was not a bad percentage considering the total number
of cases stricken, the hardships and restrictions, the
weather conditions, the intense nervous strain in the war zone
and the tremendous rolling of the big ship while in the storm.
Very few people in the sick spaces got much sleep. Everybody
helped during the terrible plague. There was work for all. It
was pitiful to see men toppling over dead at your feet. It was
like some invisible hand reaching out and suddenly taking
them away. It was truly sad and depressing.</p>

<p>The standing lights in the big spaces of the ship were
kept dim behind colored glass. Not a light was ever visible
from the ship at night and this perfect control of the
huge and vast electric circuit of the ship affords a well
merited tribute to the officer in charge. Officers on the <i>Great
Northern</i> and <i>Northern Pacific</i> as well as of the escort of
destroyers who were always with us in the dreaded war zone,
complimented us upon the <i>Leviathan’s</i> complete obscuration or
darkening of ship. Only once did a light ever show from the
big ship and that happened to shine from the room of the officer
of the deck who was on duty on the bridge. He had sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
messenger to his room for his raincoat and the boy turned on
the light to find his way about the dark room and returning to
the bridge in a hurry forgot to extinguish the light. A sharp
eyed and vigilant destroyer promptly flashed over a warning
signal and the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>Rules and prohibitions were minute and precise and were
always strictly enforced. A lighted cigarette upon a dark deck
high in the air may be seen a half a mile at sea and thus would
enable an enemy submarine to radio a lookout warning to
another “sub” lying in wait ahead. These pests of the deep
generally worked in pairs. To show how strict the rules were
one man was court martialed and sent to prison, an officer was
court martialed and reduced, and an army chaplain, who was
assisting the chaplain of the ship in administering to the dying,
was threatened with court-martial because he had opened a
port slightly in response to a dying soldier’s request for air.
These penalties may appear to be unduly harsh, but where the
safety of thousands depends upon the minute obedience of the
individual why “the punishment fits the crime.”</p>

<p>The army nurses were like ministering angels during that
dreadful scourge. They were brave American girls who
had left home and comfort in order to undergo peril and
sacrifice abroad. Surely they have earned a place in Heaven.
The bluejackets on board were second to the nurses in their
unwearying patience and generous self-denial. When the army
nurses left the ship in Brest, they wept and bade the sailors an
affectionate good-bye.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Burial of the Dead</span></h3>

<p>Upon our arrival in Brest we had on board 96 dead
soldiers and three sailors. 58 of the former were buried in
France, 33 were brought back to the States and seven were
buried at sea in the war zone on the morning after we left
Brest. We remained in Brest three days and left on the third
evening at 5:30 P.&nbsp;M. The next morning at sunrise, after an
imposing prayer by the chaplain, the flag was half-masted, taps
were sounded, three volleys fired and the coffins containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
bodies of the dead soldiers were lowered gently into the sea.
The ship was speeding at 21½ knots.</p>

<p>After seven days of mostly fair weather and without
trouble from submarines, we docked in New York on the morning
of October 16th. It was a nerve-racking voyage and we
were all greatly relieved that the trip was over.</p>

<h3><i>Tenth Overseas Trip</i></h3>

<p>At 11:10 of the morning of October 27th we left New
York bound overseas for the tenth and last trip. We had
no idea that this was to be our last run of the German blockade
with our precious cargo of Yankee doughboys. On this trip
we carried the Tank Corps, who had for their motto: “Treat
’em rough!”</p>

<p>Troops, 8,123; Adv. School 8th Division; Casual Companies
A, B, C, 487, 488, 489, 490; Tank Corps; 335th Btn.
Tank Corps.; Adv. Debarking and Billet Group 8th Division;
336th Btn. Tank Corps; 337th Btn. Tank Corps; Attached
Medical Personnel; Base Hospital No. 103; 540th Service
Btn.; October Auto Repl. Draft Camp Gordon; Casual Co. No.
452; Base Hospital No. 106; Surgical Group No. 4; Colonel
M. A. Elliott, 8th Division.</p>

<p>There had been rumors of peace while we were in New
York and we had a sort of hunch that the war could not last
much longer. The boys that we were taking over on this trip
expressed disappointment, for they, too, had the same hunch,
and regretted that they would never reach the front before the
Armistice was signed.</p>

<p>On this trip we did not go to France, but to Liverpool
instead, and as the ship needed certain repairs that would require
drydocking we landed our soldiers in England. The
trip was without any particular excitement and when we met
our escort of destroyers they signaled that all German “subs”
in that area had been recalled on October 21st. However, we
took no chances and our gun crews remained at their posts as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
usual and were as vigilant as ever. November 3rd we were in
Liverpool. On going into the channel a dense fog enveloped
the river and we were obliged to go ahead at a low speed with
the result that the tide receded before we could tie up to the
landing stage and we were stuck in the mud for about seven
hours.</p>

<p>While thus stranded we landed most of our troops and at
midnight we were tied up at the landing stage. Next morning,
we went into drydock. While we were in drydock the Armistice
was signed and then—oh boy—we celebrated.</p>

<p>We were allowed liberty from 1 P.&nbsp;M. on that day and
immediately the “gobs” and doughboys started for the main
part of the city and mingled with the great crowds who paraded,
held impromptu meetings and generally “went wild.” The celebration
continued for nearly a week and the American soldiers
and sailors participated with great spirit.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving day found us still in drydock and this was
another big day for our crew, for a football game had been
previously arranged between the army engineers and our crew
and everyone was keyed up to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>Practice was held for two weeks on a cinder field adjoining
the drydock yards. It was found necessary to have our
football togs made in Liverpool by a woman dressmaker, as
no sporting goods store carried them. Thanksgiving day came.
There was a grand and glorious dinner and then we all proceeded
to Everton Football Field in Liverpool which is credited
with being the best field in England. It had been raining all
day—usual Liverpool weather—a steady downpour and the
field was muddy and slow. On one side of the field were the
sailor rooters and on the other side the soldiers. Two bands enlivened
proceedings. The first quarter ended 0-0 and through
a hard and cleanly fought game the teams battled to a tie, 0-0.
The navy team had made a remarkable showing and considering
circumstances did well in preventing the army from scoring.
The <i>Leviathan</i> boys had not practiced as long as the army, who
had been playing all season, and furthermore the army had at
least 8,000 men to pick from while the navy had but 2,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Credit must be given to Lt. R. H. Jones, who coached the team
and its success was greatly due to his hard work.</p>

<p>Several English newspaper men were present to witness
and report the game. Following is an account of the game
from their viewpoint:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A demonstration of the nearest approach to actual warfare
was given this afternoon at Everton Field by the American bluejackets
of the <i>Leviathan</i> and the American Army Engineers of
Knotty Ash. The game greatly differs from the English rugby and
is the nearest thing to warfare that we have ever seen. We were
greatly surprised that there were not more casualties than there
were, for the opposing teams went at each other as though they
were deadly enemies about to destroy each other by brute force.</p>

</div>

<p>On Thanksgiving evening various dances and receptions
were held for the Americans in Liverpool by the people of that
city, and though we were 3,000 miles from the States we had
a most enjoyable time. We certainly had lots to be thankful
for.</p>

<p>On December 2nd we began to take on wounded soldiers
that had been in hospitals in England and were waiting transportation
to the States. We left Liverpool on December 4th, at
11 A.&nbsp;M., for Brest, France. We arrived in Brest the next
morning at 11 A.&nbsp;M. and immediately started to coal ship and
take on troops. This required three days and on December 8th
at 2 P.&nbsp;M. we left France with our first load of home-going
troops; they certainly were a happy lot of men. On the way
over we encountered occasional rough weather, but this did not
prevent us from speeding up and we arrived at Sandy Hook
on December 15th where we anchored for the night owing to
a dense fog.</p>

<p>As we made our way up the channel the next morning a
great reception was given the troops on board. Our coming
had been flashed by wireless and was heralded by all the newspapers.
Numerous boats came out to meet us and bells and
sirens rent the air. It was a typical New York welcome—big
and hearty.</p>

<p>There were tears of gladness in the eyes of many of the
soldiers on that frosty morning. It was the first time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they had seen their own land in many months and this coupled
with the deep feeling and spirit manifested by the people for
the returned heroes, touched all hearts. Just one year from
the date that we started our first trip overseas, we had brought
back some of the first returning troops of the war. We tied
up to our pier at 8 A.&nbsp;M. and the next day a leave party of
half the ship’s company left for a ten-day leave over Christmas.</p>

<h3><i>Christmas Aboard the Leviathan—1918</i></h3>

<p class="author">J. M.</p>

<p>Four days after our arrival in New York the crew was
paid and it was suggested that we have a Christmas party on
board ship for as many orphans as could be taken care of. The
idea met with unanimous approval and as each man was paid
he donated as much as he could afford. The amount collected
was sufficient to take care of 1,200 homeless children. Notices
were sent to different orphan asylums and on Christmas
morning the happy children came aboard for a good day’s fun.</p>

<p>The children were shown over the ship and a number who
went on exploring tours of their own came to grief, tumbling
out of stacks and ventilators and as black as the ace of spades.
But that did not matter, it was all in their day’s fun and when
dinner time came and the bugler sounded mess call they did
not have to be informed what the call meant. They knew it
was for dinner, why bless me, hadn’t they smelt the odor of
roast turkey all over the ship. The dinner consisted of turkey,
candied sweet potatoes, asparagus, celery, peas, cake, apples,
oranges and bananas, milk, cocoa, and ice cream of three
different kinds. All of this was prepared in the ships galley by
the ship’s cooks and bakers and was a great compliment to their
efficiency. But they enjoyed preparing it, you bet they did.
After the children had eaten everything in sight and pocketed
what was left, the mess hall was cleared of tables and
benches and all the children gathered around the giant Christmas
tree to receive a present. There was a Santa Claus, some
say it was one of our chief petty officers, but most of us, the
children most of all, believe he was the original St. Nick himself,
for he certainly was generous with his presents. There
was more than enough to go around—many of the children
received two presents.</p>

<p>The children were rounded up at 4 o’clock. As the time
neared for one group of boys to depart it was found that two
were missing and after an hour’s search they were found in
the main engine room being entertained by the men on watch.</p>

<p>When the children had gone the sailors came in for their
presents. Each man aboard received a bag from the Red
Cross. The bags contained candy, cigarettes, pipes and tobacco
and were donated by individual women from all over the
country. The gifts were greatly appreciated by the “gobs,” one
of whom voiced the sentiments of all on board by exclaiming
that the Red Cross, take it from him, was “some Santa Claus.”</p>

<h3>Notes on Handling the U. S. S. “Leviathan”</h3>

<p class="author">By <span class="smcap">Captain William W. Phelps, U. S. Navy</span></p>

<p>The power to drive the Leviathan is distributed into turbines
driving the four propellers. In the open sea the steam
is distributed in what we call the high pressure cruising combination,
whereby the turbines operate at their highest economy.
But in this combination the engines cannot be thrown back
instantly, so that in the open ocean in considering her safety
and manœuvering, the rudder effect only can be relied upon.
She must be considered as having no backing effect. For leaving
port, entering port and manœuvering about the dock or
about the anchorage, there is thrown in what is called the
manœuvering combination. In this combination the highest
speed the ship is capable of is sixteen knots ahead, and the
combination permits steam to be thrown into the backing turbines.
When there is little or no wind the ship steers very well.
When it blows strong on the beam or on the quarter, the enormous
area of the ship’s freeboard makes her act like a catboat,
she wants to fly up into the wind. She requires a weather helm
or to put it in modern language, a lee rudder. She will turn
very quickly into the wind, but she will turn away from the
wind only slowly and reluctantly. Consequently we always
dislike going into New York or out of New York in a gale of
wind, where the restricted channel requires prompt and accurate
turning of the ship. Under normal conditions the manœuvering
of the ship with her propellers, in spite of her great
length of 954 feet, is all that can be desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New York Harbor</span></h3>

<p>Ambrose Channel is dredged to forty feet at low water.
On the spring tides the low water may fall another foot, leaving
but thirty-nine feet in the Ambrose Channel at low water.
As the ship draws between thirty-nine and forty feet on arrival
at New York, it is not safe to try to enter at any other stage
of the tide than at high water. Owing to her great bulk it is
improbable that any amount of tugs could dock the ship at
Hoboken when the current is running in the North River, so
for docking at Hoboken, the ship’s arrival must be timed so
that she is off Hoboken at the slack water. As the slack water
at Hoboken is after the slack water in Ambrose Channel, we
enter Ambrose Channel then at high water and carry slackwater
all the way up the channel and dock at Hoboken on the
high water slack tide. On sailing from Hoboken she is undocking
on the low water slack tide, so as to arrive in Ambrose
Channel at the next high water. The deep draft of the ship
on leaving New York, namely, forty-one feet ten inches, requires
that in leaving New York Harbor and as far as the Narrows,
the ship must seek what might be called the prehistoric gorge
of the Hudson River. There are many places between Hoboken
and the Narrows even in what ordinarily would be called the
navigable fairway, that are so shallow that the <i>Leviathan</i> would
go aground. This prehistoric gorge is accurately known to
Captain William S. McLaughlin, Master Pilot of the New York-Sandy
Hook Pilots, who always pilots the <i>Leviathan</i> out and in.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Directing the Docking of the U. S. S. “Leviathan”</span></p>
</div>

<p>In docking the <i>Leviathan</i> there is no particular trick that
must be known, but on undocking her it must be so timed that
while on the New Jersey side at Hoboken the water is dead
slack, the flood on the New York side has just begun to make.
This helps the operation in two ways. First, by getting her
away from the dock before the flood current begins to press her
against the dock, and second when she backs out, the beginning
of the flood current on the New York side assists to turn her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
stern upstream and operates to point her correctly. In leaving
New York for sea, the ship must be manœuvered over to the
New York side, the deepest water being on the New York side.
In midstream and on the New Jersey side, between Hoboken
and the Statue of Liberty, there is not enough water to float
the <i>Leviathan</i>. In docking and undocking we need from fourteen
to sixteen tugs. Abnormal conditions can be expected in
the winter months. Upstate freshets and northerly gales sometimes
operate to kill the flood current off Hoboken and to cause
a continuing ebb current. Such a condition has happened,
making it impossible to point the ship correctly downstream,
and it has been necessary to yield to the elements and to permit
her to turn the ship. There is always an apprehension in
entering and leaving New York Harbor lest merchant vessels
carelessly anchor themselves in the <i>Leviathan’s</i> fairway. Such
a condition adds difficulties to the piloting of the ship.</p>

<p>Like most passenger vessels she is designed to have a slow
and easy roll, which means that she has not a great margin of
stability. In entering New York, bringing troops homeward,
it is necessary to keep the troops in control and evenly distributed,
because in their excitement and happiness, they tend
to rush from one side to another on the passing of every cheering
ferryboat, heeling over even this great ship. When this
ship heels over, owing to her great beam, and to her box-like
dead-flat section, it materially increases her already great draft.
Large ballast tanks with suitable pumps are provided for the
purpose of counteracting the tendency of the ship to heel over,
but in spite of this, at sea she lies over to the breeze, and in
entering New York she is very sensitive to the movement of
troops about the deck.</p>

<p>In mooring to the buoy in Brest Harbor, it is an advantage
to arrive at slack water; she must be brought to the buoy with
her momentum entirely gone, for her great weight of sixty-nine
thousand tons, if moving when the buoy is correctly placed,
would make it impossible for the mooring party to handle the
great heavy links of four-inch chain, and to connect the mooring
shackle.</p>

<h3><i>Drydocking the U. S. S. “Leviathan” in
Gladstone Dock, Liverpool, England</i></h3>

<p class="author">By <span class="smcap">Lieut. A. W. Minuse, U. S. N. R. F.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/illus26.jpg" width="175" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Drydocking a ship in a graving
dock means placing the ship in a dock
or basin at the entrance of which is a
gate or caisson, accurately centering
the ship over a system of blocks or
beds, previously prepared according
to plans and then pumping the water
out of the dock.</p>

<p>When a ship is designed the Naval
Architect always prepares a docking
plan showing in detail just how to
prepare these beds so that the ship will
rest evenly without straining her in
any way. Ordinarily, docking a ship
up to 32,000 or 33,000 tons is not
much of a problem, nor does it involve
much of a risk, but on larger ships with all the necessary data
known, those connected with the docking always feel easier when
they see the ship setting safely on the blocks.</p>

<p>To give some idea of the size of the <i>Leviathan</i> consider
our latest, biggest and most powerful battleship, the <i>New
Mexico</i>. She weighs 32,000 tons. The <i>Leviathan</i> weighed
or displaced at the time of docking more than twice this, or
approximately 66,000 tons.</p>

<p>We had no docking plans nor plans of any description
showing her form or construction. The Germans had either
destroyed or removed all her plans. This was the problem
we were confronted with in January, 1918, when it was decided
to dock the ship in Liverpool for the necessary cleaning and
painting of her body under water, and doing other necessary
work, including a clump on her forefoot for towing the paravanes,
or mine-sweeping device.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="425" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In Dry Dock</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Liverpool Drydock</span></h3>

<p>The Gladstone Dock in Liverpool was the only drydock
in the world at the time that would take the Leviathan. The
entire development of this dock, which included a tidal basin,
was not completed when the war broke out, so the tidal basin
was abandoned and one of a pair of docks was finished up and
a long channel dredged to the River Mersey.</p>

<p>The ship drew so much that we could not enter the dock
except at the spring tides, or in other words, only about two
days out of a month would permit us to enter the dock, provided
the wind did not cut the tide too much.</p>

<p>The next thing was to decide on how to prepare the beds
of the drydock to receive the ship. An examination of her
bottom was necessary. Divers were sent down and they reported
that she had neither docking nor bilge keels, and that
her keel plate consisted of a plate of about 2 inches thick by
3 feet wide.</p>

<p>In converting the ship from a passenger to a troop ship,
we naturally became familiar with every detail of her construction.
With this knowledge of her construction and due
consideration being given to the location of the heavy weights,
etc., it was decided to place the main bed under the third intercostal,
this bed running from frames 220 to 101, or a distance
of 358 feet amidships. The spacing of these blocks was 6 feet,
or every other frame space. The center of these blocks was
25½ feet from the center line of the ship.</p>

<p>In addition to the center line bed, which is placed underneath
the keel, and the two main beds, one port and one starboard,
which is placed under the third intercostal, an outer
bed, consisting of four sets of five blocks each, space 6 feet
centers, was placed under the fore and aft coal bunker bulkhead,
at the intersection of the thwartship bulkheads.</p>

<p>The fore and aft center of these blocks came at frame
199, 174, 151 and 126. Blocks of the outer bed were staggered
with those of the inner bed. This outer bed was 35
feet from the center of the ship. At the fore and aft ends
of the ship where the dead-rise is considerable, an inner bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a few inches from the center of the ship for a distance of 60
feet was prepared, 12 feet 6 inches forward, and 13 feet
9 inches aft.</p>

<p>After deciding the location of these beds, the next step
was to get some idea of how to prepare them, so that they
would conform to the shape of the ship. Preparing the center
line bed was of course easier, as it was known that the keel of
the ship was a straight line.</p>

<p>The forward end of the center line bed consisted of a
solid line of blocks for a distance of 104 feet, and the after
end of a solid line of blocks for 144 feet, where exceptionally
heavy weights would be carried. The balance of the blocks
was spaced every 15 inch centers, except in the way of water-tight
bulkheads. Under these bulkheads the blocks were filled
in solid for 7 blocks. On each side of these, two spaces were
omitted and then filled in solid for 5 blocks. Reference to the
docking plans will show the spacing of these blocks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Blocks and Beds</span></h3>

<p>An idea of the blocks used in building the beds can be
had by referring to the photograph. They consisted of 3 cast
steel wedges, which, when placed upon each other, were about
3 feet high, 15 inches wide at the bottom, and 3 feet 6 inches
long. On top of these steel wedges was placed a hardwood
block 12 inches square and 4 feet long, and on top of the hardwood
blocks was placed a soft wood cap 12 inches wide by
4 inches thick by 4 feet long.</p>

<p>To prepare the main, inner and outer beds, it was necessary
to have some idea of the form of the ship. By opening
up the water-tight doors in the fireroom we were able to get a
base line 300 feet long. Every other double bottom tank was
pumped out and offsets taken at the fore and aft ends of these
tanks, in way of the main, inner and outer beds. The taking
of these offsets was greatly facilitated by the fact that the
double bottom was found to be flat in both the fore and aft
thwartships direction. Buttocks were run through these offsets.
While these buttocks faired up very well, it was realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the measurements would not be accurate enough for the actual
preparation of the beds; therefore they were prepared to
within 4 inches of these measurements.</p>

<p>Several hundred wedges of varying thicknesses were made
ready in advance, and after the ship was placed on the center
line blocks, the space between the main and outer beds and
the ship’s bottom was packed with the wedges by divers.</p>

<p>The Gladstone Dock was prepared according to the above
description, carefully checked and measured, and then flooded
to about 10 feet, so that no one could tamper with it. After
the dock was prepared, we had to wait several days for a spring
tide, and also to dredge out a shifting shoal at the entrance of
the channel leading to the dock.</p>

<p>The first tide that the ship could enter the dock was at
11:50 A.&nbsp;M., January 14, 1918. She was brought to as even
a keel as possible, which was 35 feet 9 inches forward and
37 feet 6 inches aft. This was accomplished by filling the
forward tanks and emptying the after tanks and placing about
1,400 tons of coal in her reserve and forward bunkers. This
was the nearest to an even keel that we had ever had the ship
up to this time in the light condition. I might mention here
that in this condition the ship is extremely tender, and that
Lieut. Watts of the Engineering Department, displayed great
diligence and good judgment in keeping her perfectly upright,
while setting her on the blocks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Entering the Dock</span></h3>

<p>On January 14, 1918, the ship proceeded down the Mersey
River to the entrance of the dock, but the wind was too high to
attempt making the entrance, and we had to return to Princess
Landing. On the 15th conditions were much better but none
too favorable. However, as it was the last day of the spring tide
we had to make the attempt. The spring tides are about 21
feet, and the current is very swift, so we had less than an hour
in which to enter the dock and close the caisson.</p>

<p>The entrance was very narrow, so that tugs were of little
assistance and she had to go in under her own power. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a fine piece of seamanship and was successfully accomplished
without damage to either the ship or the dock. The handling
of the ship in the long entrance channel to the dock was done
by the Senior Captain of the Cunard Line on shore. We were
all greatly shocked about two weeks later to learn of his death,
due to a channel steamer being torpedoed on its return from
France, where he had been called on an important conference.
It was the loss of such fine men through the treacherous German
submarines that brought home to us more than ever our solemn
duty to beat the Germans at all costs.</p>

<p>On the 16th everything was ready for setting her on the
center line blocks. The weather conditions were ideal; the
wind was on the stern and the ship was on an even keel. The
stern touched the blocks and she settled at 3:55 P.&nbsp;M.</p>

<p>Previous to setting the ship on the blocks 12 sighting
battons were erected along the level of “B” deck from stem to
stem, so that if the ship was strained in any way it could be
readily noted. A piano wire was also stretched from side to
side at the top of the thwartships coal bunkers amidships and
connected to a spring balance, so that any opening up effect,
due to the divers not properly packing the main beds, would
immediately show.</p>

<p>As soon as the stern touched the blocks the top row of side
shores were set up commencing from aft. These shores were
spaced every 5 frames, or about 15 feet centers. Altogether
there were three rows of these side shores. The water was
then lowered to a depth of 32 feet and the water maintained
at this depth while the divers packed the main, inner and outer
beds. As soon as possible after the water reached 32 feet,
the water in all the tanks was pumped out with the exception
of the feed tanks and No. 23 and 24 fresh water service tanks.
The stem and side anchors were lowered and the pig iron in
No. 17 tank, amounting to about 473 tons, was removed.</p>

<p>The water was maintained in the dock at 32 feet, because
at this depth the ship was just resting nicely on the center line
blocks and would not compress the soft wood caps. We did
not want any unnecessary weight on the center line blocks until
the divers had finished their work on the main and outer beds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
so that when the dock was finally pumped out, the ship would
imbed itself in the soft wood capping at a uniform depth.
This worked out exceptionally well, and was remarkably uniform
on all beds, amounting to about 2 inches at the end of
the third day. On the third day the spring balance on the
piano wire registered less than an ounce difference. The
sighting battons showed that she had settled amidships about
1⅜ inches. After floating she returned to ⅛ inch of the
original condition. This I believe to be the natural hog of
the ship.</p>

<p>The undocking of the ship was somewhat unusual in that
7,800 tons of coal were placed aboard while she was in dry
dock, 1,400 tons while the dock was absolutely dry and the
balance of the coal, with from 35 to 37 feet of water in the
dock. This was not sufficient to float the ship, and she still
rested upon the docking beds. Immediately before letting in
the water, all the bilge and hanging shores, and shores under,
the stem and stern that would in any way injure the ship should
she take a sudden list, or any undue change of trim, were
removed. These shores were removed at about 15 minute intervals,
so that the ship could adjust itself and any undue
settling could be noticed. During this operation men were
stationed at the sighting battons and the piano wire. Water
was then admitted as quickly as possible to 35 feet and maintained
at this level while additional coal was put aboard from
barges admitted to the dock at low tide. This was a rather
trying ordeal, but was successfully accomplished in 5 days.</p>

<p>Arrangements had been made to leave the dock on
February 11th. It was therefore decided to float her on the
10th, and an estimate was made of the coal on board and
such tanks as were necessary to bring her to an even trim and
even keel, were filled. She floated at 1:20 on the 10th with
38 feet 11 inches draft aft, 39 feet 6 inches draft forward,
and less than ½° list to starboard.</p>

<p>I cannot speak too highly of the hearty co-operation received
from the ship’s officers and crew, especially Naval Constructor
J. H. Jack, U. S. N. This applies not only to the
docking of the ship, but to her conversion from a passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ship to a transport. No duty was too strenuous or hours too
long, and during the conversion the living quarters on the ship
were not of the best. They were continually shifted from one
part of the ship to the other, even the meals were of a
makeshift character and at times irregular. Every man seemed
to realize what we were up against and that we must make
good. Everyone pulling together, accomplishment was made
possible.</p>

<p>The conversion of the ship to a transport speaks volumes
for the Navy Department organization and more particularly
for the New York Navy Yard, under whose direct supervision
the work was undertaken.</p>

<p>The ship was so big that she could not be taken to a
shipyard, nor transferred to the Navy Yard. The task had
to be undertaken where she lay at her piers in Hoboken and
the New York Navy Yard organization was elastic enough and
active enough to carry on the work outside the Navy Yard.</p>

<h3><i>The Bridge</i></h3>

<p class="author">W. J.</p>

<p>General conditions on the bridge were good. Instruments
had deteriorated somewhat, owing to the long stay in port and
not being used.</p>

<p>All signal flags and navigation instruments, including
the three chronometers which comprised part of her equipment
were removed. The ship was equipped with two master gyroscopic
compasses installed on “G” deck and seven repeaters for
use on the bridge in steering and taking bearings; these were all
found to be more or less in need of repairs and after days of
hard and tedious work on the part of Lieut. W. H. F. Schluter
and his well organized staff they were put in fine condition
and have been kept in this manner constantly even though he
has had to add pieces of lead to each master gyro to maintain
a level. Being of German manufacture, no spare parts could
be obtained during the war, but whenever they were needed
Lieutenant Schluter proved to be the “man of the hour.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The gyros were only one of his many troubles for, being electrical
officer, there were numerous other duties about the ship.
There were a great many German charts left on board but the
ship was equipped by the Bureau of Navigation with American
charts before leaving port. The steering gears and all the
telegraphs were changed to English speaking. The deep-sea
sounding machines are still in commission after a great amount
of usage, and the motors attached to them for heaving in the
lead are still in good working order. The patent log for
measuring distance is the “Forbes,” an English patent. Loudspeaking
telephones reached to all the principal parts of the
ship, and are very much used. A fire-alarm indicator is placed
in the wheelhouse and is set at fifteen-minute intervals. This
indicator has pipes leading to all holds through which the
smoke from any fire in a hold would be drawn and can be
seen in the wheelhouse when the alarm goes off. A steam hose
can be connected to the pipe and the fire smothered. There
is a control for operating water-tight doors and a diagram showing
location of each door; upon this diagram an electric light
burns when each door is closed, showing the officer of the deck
whether the control works properly.</p>

<p>The big 44-inch searchlight on the foremast is controlled
very readily from the bridge by a small lever; the fog
bell is rung and all whistles are blown by an electrical attachment.
The master electric clock is on the bridge and gives
the time to 550 repeaters situated throughout the ship. These
clocks required a great amount of painstaking labor to be put
into good condition and demand constant care and supervision.
During the alterations in which first class staterooms were
ripped out to make troop quarters, the wiring system to the
clocks was torn out by the workmen as well as everything else
which happened to be in their path.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously the ship’s chronometers, three in
number, were missing. These were afterwards found by the
Secret Service in a nautical school in New York City. The
commanding officer had to send them to the Naval Observatory
at Washington, D. C. This was done with great reluctance as
they were of the finest type and a good chronometer is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
valuable and much used article aboard a ship. Others were
sent to replace them. The bridge and signal bridge were
altered for transport purposes. The fire control and range finder
stations being built on the signal bridge, and the fine bright
finish of the wood was changed to the more popular color at
that time—the war gray. Otherwise the <i>Leviathan</i> remains
the <i>Vaterland</i>, as when she was in the merchant service—a
German transport in disguise.</p>

<h3><i>The Deck Force</i></h3>

<p class="author">F. C. W.</p>

<p>When the <i>Leviathan</i> was taken over by the Navy, the chief
difficulty that presented itself was the scarcity of men available
for the deck force. Only a few of the crew that had been
assigned to the ship had ever been to sea. A few—gun crews,
for the most part—had had some experience, but not enough
to qualify them as seamen. This was partly due to their short
terms of service.</p>

<p>As a result, the brunt of the work fell upon the shoulders
of a few experienced petty officers, who fortunately had been
assigned to the ship. These men worked day and night in a
supreme effort to organize their crews and create a working
machine. For the first few days they did everything from
scrubbing the decks to exploring the double bottoms. There
was no distinction between the rated men and the seamen in this
line of work.</p>

<p>The size of the ship added to the confusion. It was impossible
to keep a detail together for more than a minute and a
half. It was easy for an entire working party to get lost between
decks. It was easier for some to get lost than others.
Finally, it was decided that the only way to keep a working
party together was to hang a bell around the neck of the petty
officer in charge. This scheme worked well until two working
parties met, when it was necessary to call in a traffic cop to get
them separated.</p>

<p>Because of their unfamiliarity with the ship, details were
apt to deliver sacks of “spuds” to the Commander’s cabin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
stationery to the blacksmith shop. This situation was relieved by
the appointment of guides to conduct the working parties around.</p>

<p>The parts of the ship allotted to the deck division (at that
time we could only boast of one), were in rather good shape,
considering the time the ship had been laid up. The weather
decks were littered up like an old woman’s backyard after a
hard day’s washing, but most of the truck was movable. Boats
were piled across the hatches and all over the decks, making it
impossible to get around. Boxes, stores and cordage were
everywhere.</p>

<p>The process of making the ship habitable was accomplished
by a mere handful of men, most of the division being assigned
to various details for work in other compartments.</p>

<p>After the work of cleaning up had been completed, attention
was turned to the rigging. The running rigging was in
bad shape and it was found necessary to refit all of the davits
that were rigged with manila rope. The booms were also refitted
with new whips and guys. Requisitions for wire and
manila lines were made right and left and all of the rigging
was overhauled.</p>

<p>Of the 72 boats on board, 26 were equipped with friction
winches and needed no power for rigging out and loading.
The power for hoisting was furnished by electric motors, each
one operating two or more winches. These winches were given
a thorough overhauling and found to be in excellent condition.
The boat falls, which were of special laid wire, were then
unrove and tested. Only two of the entire number needed
attention. At that time we had no serviceable wire, and it
was a case of a few well-made long splices.</p>

<p>The ground tackle on the ship was all that could be desired.
Of the three Hall type anchors, the largest, or stem
anchor, weighed a little more than twelve tons. The other two,
port and starboard, tipped the scales at eleven tons. These
little trinkets were the only articles on board considered safe
from souvenir hunters. For the information of landsmen, the
“anchor watch” has no connection with the anchor itself, but
is merely the men on watch as Officer of the Deck’s night messengers
while the ship is at anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem anchor was fitted with a 4-inch stud link chain,
150 fathoms in length. The port and starboard anchors had
chains of 164 and 150 fathoms, respectively. The chains for
the latter were three and three-eighths inches in diameter, the
size of a chain being measured by the diameter of the material
of which the links are formed.</p>

<p>The anchor engines were of corresponding size, and could
be connected with the capstans on deck. In addition to them,
there were seven more engines for capstans in all parts of the
ship. In consequence, mooring the ship to a dock was not the
hard task that it usually is.</p>

<p>The stern anchor and chain had apparently been left in
Hamburg. The hawse pipe aft, and the stern chain locker were
utilized for the handling and stowage of the heavy manila
hawsers.</p>

<p>Most of the manila hawsers on board had to be replaced.
Natural decay or possibly a small application of acid had so
weakened the lines that they had a tendency to break at the most
inopportune moments. The wire hawsers, however, were in
A-1 condition, and up until the present time, have never been
replaced.</p>

<p>But the work of fitting out was not all that had to be
done. Men must be fed; and it seemed, from the accumulation
of provisions on the dock, that we were being depended upon
for the entire job of feeding the A. E. F. Truckload after truckload
of stores was piled on the dock, and hoisted aboard, day
after day. We soon learned that one trip with 10,000 red
blooded men aboard involved the consumption of almost everything
we had been piling into the ship’s storerooms and refrigerators.
Besides food, there were general stores to be handled,
including everything from safety pins to dishwashing machines.
Every department was working overtime to get things ship-shape,
and the deck force most of all.</p>

<p>At last it was rumored that we were about to make our
maiden trip under the American flag. This was followed by a
speeding up in all departments. It received final substantiation
when military equipment and stores began to arrive. The time
had come for a real test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a chance to test our booms when a five-ton truck
showed up as a part of the equipment to be loaded. The booms
were of three-ton capacity and it was necessary to strengthen the
lifts and rig a purchase in lieu of the single whip. It was taken
aboard without mishap.</p>

<p>Just before leaving all boat-falls were given a final test.
Every boat was rigged out and lowered to within a few feet of
the water. A party of sixty-five men then clambered in and
the boat was hoisted and lowered ten feet or more. This party
was used for all of the boats, which were found to be in satisfactory
condition. A few boats not on davits were hoisted overboard
and tested for watertightness.</p>

<p>One morning in the fall of 1917 we slipped away. There
were many conjectures as to our destination, one opinion being
that we were bound for Panama for a last overhauling in dry
dock. It developed that we were taking 1,500 marines to
Guantanamo.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival in Cuba, we discharged all equipment
and turned our attention to the boats once more. The boat
officers were given their first lesson in the handling of the boat
winches, and some of the men were given their first experience
in a boat under oars.</p>

<p>Back again to Hoboken—more handling of stores and provisions.
The Marines, although few in number, had managed
to put quite a hole in our store of provisions. But the worst
was yet to come. Orders sending the ship to France came, and
with them 7,500 soldiers.</p>

<p>We had one piece of luck in getting off. While the crews
of other transports had been compelled to sit and watch civilian
stevedores put their stores aboard, the crew of the <i>Leviathan</i>
were allowed to handle everything going aboard the ship themselves.
There were no restrictions whatever, permission even
being given to work night and day at the job. All of the equipment
handled by the civilian stevedores belonging to the army.
The crew handled all of the naval equipment aboard, including
Liberty motors, aeroplanes and S. P. boats.</p>

<p>Liverpool had the honor of receiving us on our first and
second voyages. Here we went into dry dock for final repairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and here we had our first experience coaling ship in drydock.
Coaling was carried on from cars running along the dock and
also from small lighters or flats in the dock itself. The lighters
were emptied and taken away only at certain stages of the tide.
There was always a chance of the ship floating during one of
these manœuvers, and the work of bringing loaded lighters into
the dock and sending the emptied ones out required quick
action and plenty of it. The notorious punctuality of time and
tide is especially noticeable in the Liverpool drydock, and
we worked at all hours of the day and night to keep in step.</p>

<p>The bottom of the ship was given a new coat of paint, and
we left for Hoboken and more troops. On our second voyage
to Liverpool our paravanes were installed, adding a little to the
work, but contributing a good deal to our sense of security.
Once more, for the benefit of the landsman: The paravanes, or
PVs, are contrivances fitted to the bow of the ship, as a protection
against mines, so constructed that they will automatically
pick up the moorings of a mine and cut it adrift.</p>

<p>Beginning with our third trip, we worked on an express
train schedule. Everything depended upon speed. Our cargoes
increased at the same time. In addition to all kinds of
army equipment, we frequently carried aeroplanes, boats for
overseas duty, and on one trip a large mooring buoy. In order
to load them on board, additional changes had to be made in
the rigging, purchases and guys of the booms. Even the weather
decks were utilized for the transportation of cargo for the naval
forces overseas.</p>

<p>At the present writing the good old ship is still on the job—bringing
them back. The machine is running as smoothly as
the ship’s engines, and instead of having a few inexperienced
men in the deck force, we have an organization, built from
almost nothing, that can compete with anything in the navy.</p>

<h3><i>Embarkation and Debarkation of Troops</i></h3>

<p class="author">W. S. A.</p>

<p>This is a brief description of how the <i>Leviathan’s</i> human
cargo was loaded and unloaded. The plan had been followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
from the beginning with slight changes made by experience
in carrying troops over before the armistice and
carrying them back afterwards.</p>

<p>The ship’s troop capacity began at 6,800 and on the 13th
voyage it was approximately 12,000. Throughout the war
it averaged about 10,000. In addition, officers’ space has
varied between 400 and 600.</p>

<p>Throughout the war, carrying troops east, five gangways
were employed on G-deck forward, to fill forward compartments;
C-deck and F-decks amidships, to fill amidship compartments;
E-deck and G-deck gangways aft to fill after compartments.</p>

<p>On each gangway, the compartment farthest away and
lowest was filled and so on to the gangway compartment. In
no case did troops crowd through a filled compartment.</p>

<p>It was early realized that loading the ship with troops
was a Navy function and was treated as such. The organization
at each of the five gangways was: one naval officer in
charge and assisted by one chief petty officer and fifteen men.
Wherever Army officers were available one was detailed to
assist the Naval officer.</p>

<p>Prior to embarkation on each voyage, the ship’s embarkation
officer made an assignment of all troops the ship was
to carry, so organizations would not be split up but located
in the same part of the ship to facilitate work. Often this was
a problem on account of the arrival of trains or ferries and
the size of organizations carried. Also, troop compartments
had an arbitrary number of bunks in them, based on the amount
which could be put in and not upon the number in military
organizations. By planning we were able to get a complete
regiment amidships, one aft, and a battalion forward, then
filling in smaller units up to capacity.</p>

<p>Generally a battalion, or approximately 1,000 men, came
to the ship a day in advance of embarkation for the guard and
mess details. The next day the balance of the troops arrived.
When the guard was not posted before embarkation, the troops
were all over decks, superstructure, and masts, resulting in
much unnecessary confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Embarkation usually began about 8 o’clock or 9 o’clock
in the morning, although on one occasion it began as early
as 5:30 A.&nbsp;M. Organizations marched on the dock, both upper
and lower levels, the Army checkers checked the individual
soldier’s names upon the passenger lists and the soldier would
receive a billet ticket which showed his compartment, bunk
number, deck space, abandon ship station, safety rules, etc.
Then the column would move over the gangway and the prescribed
routes to the compartment. Each of the five columns
were led by a Naval guide, and other Naval guides were posted
along the route and seven or eight Navy men in the compartment,
to direct the columns to the proper bunks and put the
soldiers in the bunks called for by the billet tickets. The numbering
in compartments generally began in the forward starboard
corner and ended in the after port corner. Later on,
the bunks in the amidship compartments were renumbered so
that a column of troops could be directed up a passageway and
men could get into the bunks on both sides of it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rules Observed</span></h3>

<p>A company officer would go into the compartment being
filled and assist the Navy detail; troops got into their bunks as
soon as found, and stayed there until embarkation over that
gangway was completed. No smoking was allowed in compartments.
Without strict adherence to these rules, embarkation
was hindered. Generally it was possible to take troops
aboard nearly as fast as they arrived on the dock and many
times the dock would be emptied before the next organizations
would arrive. The troop mess hall on F-deck was
used as a reservoir to hold over 1,000 troops marching in a
serpentine line which proceeded into the compartments being
filled. The Naval officer in charge of the gangway circulated
from the gangway over the route into the compartment and
saw that all went smoothly. The embarkation officer moved
around all gangways into compartments being filled and upon
the deck, generally overseeing and directing embarkation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The Navy men for the forward gangway were from the
first division, midship gangways from the third division and
the other gangways from the fourth division. With the inborn
aptitude of the American youth, they soon became experts in
embarking and made short work of filling compartments.
There was little change in the details during the entire war
period. The men took real pride in their work. Embarkation
of 10,000 troops, each soldier into his own numbered
bunk, could not have been effected in a period of six to eight
hours, if it had not been for the zeal and ardor and intelligence
which the men put into their work.</p>

<p>Whenever a bunk was found which could not be used and
compartments were checked over before embarkation, the
ticket was taken up from the soldier and another secured at
the gangway so the man could occupy a bunk in the vicinity
of his company.</p>

<p>Relations between the ship’s officers concerned with embarking
and the army officers of the port of embarkation staff were
harmonious and co-operation grew as trips increased. On
some occasions the ship’s officers went to the army camps,
gave talks and distributed ship’s pamphlets in advance of embarkation
which were of assistance in embarking and getting
the army settled on board.</p>

<p>On these war time embarkations, one noted the eagerness
with which the troops came aboard to get to the scene of
war. On one occasion a number of colored troops went up
E-deck gangway, which had an angle of nearly forty-five degrees,
upon their hands and knees for safety’s sake. This
caused great laughter.</p>

<p>Only on one or two embarkations were there any substantial
delays, as trains and ferries generally arrived on
schedule. Once an entire regiment was fitted up with two pairs
of trench shoes upon the upper level of the dock. During the
influenza epidemic in the fall of 1918 taking the temperatures
of all troops slowed up embarkation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Debarkations</span></h3>

<p>During the war, debarkation on the first two trips to Liverpool
was simply to march the troops over the G-deck forward,
F-deck amidships, and G-deck after gangways on the landing
stage in reverse order of embarkation, where they mustered
by organizations and entrained. On the third trip to Liverpool,
in November, 1918, the <i>Leviathan</i> ran her nose into the
Mersey mud off the Gladstone dock in a heavy fog. The tide
ebbed and the ship began to list. All the Mersey ferry boats
were commandeered and the 8,000 troops were debarked on
them from F-deck gangway amidships and G-deck gangway
aft, in three hours. Gangways to the ferries in several cases
were at an angle of sixty degrees. Debarkation was rushed
to lighten the ship, and she was backed off on the rising tide
that evening under her own power.</p>

<p>At Brest, during the war, a different plan was followed.
Coaling began soon after the ship was moored. G-deck gangways
aft, port and starboard sides, were the only gangways
available to debark troops onto lighters. B-deck and the troop
mess hall were used as debarking mustering stations. Organizations
moved to them from their compartments, according to
prearranged plan, as it was essential to send the troops ashore
by organizations. B-deck held about 1,800 men with their
packs and the mess hall about 1,200. When assembled, they
moved to lighters lying at the after gangway. These held
at first according to size, from 600 to 2,200 men and they were
packed tight. Their capacity was reduced on later voyages.</p>

<p>The troops cheered the old <i>Leviathan</i> as their lighters drew
away, and our men responded. The <i>Leviathan</i> carried many
organizations which later paid heavy toll of casualties in
battles.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed and the westbound tide
set in, it required considerable work to reverse the procedure
of embarking at Brest and debarking at Hoboken. The entire
embarkation was over G-deck gangway for all compartments
up to the thirteenth voyage, as it proceeded during coaling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The procedure of filling compartments was the same, but
it was necessary to unload lighters quickly and get them away
so the line of troops to compartments was extended to fill
A-deck, B-deck, D-deck forward and aft, from whence the line
of troops fed down into the compartments.</p>

<p>From 1,100 to 2,200 sick and wounded were embarked
at the same time as the other troops, this was done under supervision
of the medical officer, assisted by the hospital corps.
The casuals were taken to sick bay or E-deck compartments
especially set aside for them.</p>

<p>Debarkation at Hoboken was the quick and happy event
following the reception the ship received coming up the harbor.
G-deck forward, C and F-decks amidships, and G-deck after
gangways are used. The troops march out on them in reverse
order of embarking. Units muster on the dock according to
their organizations. Briefly, the procedure resembles pouring
liquid out of three different pitchers, just the reverse of filling
the compartments upon embarkation. The debarkation of
troops was completed in about three hours.</p>

<p>The dock was always a lively place with throngs of reporters
and welfare workers present with refreshments and smokes
for the boys. The canine mascots generally got aboard unobserved,
but in debarkation they proceed with their proud masters
down the gangways and are admired as returning heroes
by those upon the dock. Many of the dogs were “prisoners of
war,” having come over to the American trenches from the
enemy.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, is the story of the loading and unloading
of the <i>Leviathan’s</i> human cargo. The doughboys have bravely
done their part in winning the war. We of the <i>Leviathan</i> have
had the happy and important duty of getting them over safely
and bringing them back home.</p>

<h3><i>Abandon Ship Drill</i></h3>

<p class="author">E. E.</p>

<p>Abandon ship drill is the most important drill on board
ship as the saving of the lives of all would depend upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
degree of perfection, organization, and speed of execution. It
is easily seen that a ship the size of the <i>Leviathan</i> by reason of
her water-tight doors would not sink for several hours after a
torpedo attack or after striking a mine; thus the great danger
to be avoided is the panic attendant upon such a contingency.
The end to be attained is the conducting of all the troops in
an orderly and expeditious manner to the weather decks where,
equipped with life jackets and canteens, they can climb over
the side on sea ladders rigged for the purpose and reach the
rafts and boats already lowered into the water.</p>

<p>The abandon ship organization requires the second in army
command to be in charge of the troop movement. He has as
his assistants thirty-five captains as troop compartment officers—they
are the senior officers in each troop compartment—and
seventy lieutenants, the junior compartment officers. As a
special abandon ship detail there are twelve majors acting as
abandon ship mustering station officers and twenty-four captains
and lieutenants acting as assistants to these officers.</p>

<p>The abandon ship mustering stations are distributed over
the ship and include all available space on the weather decks
except such space as is necessary to the lowering of boats or to the
actual navigation of the ship. The routing of the troops to
these stations is worked out on the principle that all watertight
doors will be closed as soon as abandon ship signal sounds.
The capacity of these stations is limited to a minimum of three
cubic feet of deck space per man, giving also due consideration
to the disposition of the ship’s boats.</p>

<p>During the war the first abandon ship drill was held prior
to the sailing of the ship. All men aboard were obliged to
keep their life jackets within reach at all times. For the first
three drills the troops were sent below to their compartments
at the call “assembly” on the bugles so they would become
familiar with their abandon ship route. After the first three
drills, troops already up on deck proceeded directly to their
mustering stations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="425" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Going to Bring the Doughboys Home</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Troops were not required to wear their life jackets when
hostilities ceased, but when abandon ship drill was held they
were sent below to assemble in their compartments, put on
their life jackets, and then at the abandon ship call proceed
over the abandon ship route to their mustering stations to stand
by for further orders or until “secure” is sounded.</p>

<p>The plan followed throughout the ship called for the
emptying of the lowest compartment first. Other compartments
using the same abandon ship route stand fast until the
troops in the lowest compartment have filed past.</p>

<p>It was found that by this drill all compartments could
be emptied and all troops assembled at their abandon ship
mustering stations within fifteen minutes of the sounding of the
abandon ship signal, or within one half hour of the blowing of
the “assembly” which sends the troops to their compartments.</p>

<p>(Lieut. Malloy was detached as assistant Gunnery Officer in
order to take over the duties of First Lieutenant of the ship.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ship’s Gunners</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Arthur B. Dorsey, Lieut., U.S.N.; assigned, July 30, 1917; detached, January 22, 1919.</li>
<li>John T. Swift, Lieut., U.S.N.; assigned, January 22, 1919; detached, March 6, 1919.</li>
<li>James F. Williams, Gunner, U.S.N.; assigned, January 20, 1919.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Gunner Williams served on board as a Chief Gunner’s
Mate from August, 1917, until he was made Gunner in
January, 1919.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut. Boucher, Lieut. Malloy and Lieut. Dorsey, were
the officers in charge of the installation of the battery, fire
control system, etc., the training of gun crews and lookouts,
and in fact all the numerous details required to have the ship
in readiness for sea and action when she cleared the net in
New York Harbor. Great credit is due these officers and the
men of their department for the excellent manner in which this
work was carried out. Much credit is also due the officers and
men who succeeded them for the excellent manner in which
they maintained the high standard of efficiency that had been
set for them.</p>

<p>There were also six Chief Gunner’s Mates and seven gunner’s
mates of lower ratings attached to the ship during her
voyages across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>No technical discussion of ordnance and gunnery will be
attempted in these pages, just a general description of guns,
fire control systems, etc., and their method of operation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Armament and Equipment</span></h3>

<p>The armament and equipment of the <i>Leviathan</i> consisted
of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>8—6-inch 50-Cal. guns Mk. VIII.</li>
<li>2—1-Pdr. guns, Mk. VIII.</li>
<li>2—“Y”-Guns for throwing depth charges.</li>
<li>2—Colt Machine Guns.</li>
<li>1—Lewis Machine Gun.</li>
<li>150—.30-Cal. Springfield Rifles.</li>
<li>75—.45-Cal. Colt Automatic Pistols.</li>
<li>1—Large Bausch and Lomb 12-Ft. Range Finder.</li>
<li>2—Small Barr and Stroud 1-meter Range Finders.</li>
<li>1—Ford Range Keeper.</li>
</ul>

<p>The six-inch guns were installed on October 5, 1917—four
aft and four forward. The distance between the forward
and after guns was about seven hundred feet, which is a
greater distance than the entire length of any battleship we
have in commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of installation was carried on by ordnance men
from the New York Navy Yard, assisted by the ship’s gunnery
department.</p>

<p>Splendid co-ordination existed at all times between the
Navy Yard people and the ship’s force which helped materially
to expedite the work. Considerable effort and labor were
required to get the ship in readiness to receive the guns, mounts,
etc. Gun foundations and gun platforms had to be built;
blast bulkheads erected in proper places so as to protect one
gun from the fire of the other; certain portions of the deck
were extended in order to give the after guns a greater arc of
train. Lines of communication, voice tubes and telephones, had
to be run from all guns to fire control and spotting stations;
and salvo bells and buzzers installed. All of this work was
completed in record time and gave excellent results throughout
the war.</p>

<p>Foundation and mount tests were held on November 20,
1917, on our trial trip to Guantanamo, when three shots were
fired from each six-inch gun. These tests proved satisfactory
in every respect.</p>

<p>The 1-pdr. guns were not installed until September 28,
1918. These guns were mounted on the port and starboard
sides of C-deck amidships. They also proved satisfactory when
fired for tests on September 30, 1918. Lieutenant Boucher
originally made a request for four 1-pdr. guns and also two
anti-aircraft guns, but only the two 1-pdr. guns were allowed
this ship.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Depth Charges</span></h3>

<p>The original depth charge outfit of this vessel consisted
of the earlier type of depth charges, containing only fifty-two
pounds of TNT as an explosive. We were allowed ten of
the charges and a chute was rigged over the stern for launching
them.</p>

<p>On July 27, 1918, two “Y” guns were installed
which throw a charge of TNT weighing 300 pounds. These
were tested out by filling four large paint drums with wet sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to bring them up to the required weight, and firing them from
the “Y” guns. The cans landed approximately 200 feet from
the ship, our extra high freeboard causing them to travel farther
than if fired from the deck of a torpedo boat.</p>

<p>We never had the opportunity of trying our depth charges
on a real submarine. A ship of this size would have to be
extremely lucky to manœuvre so as to be in a position to drop
a depth charge on a submarine.</p>

<p>The “Y”-guns were removed December 30, 1918, after
the armistice had been signed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Machine Guns</span></h3>

<p>The two Colt machine guns were mounted forward on
C-deck gallery, abaft No. 3 and No. 4 guns, and the Lewis
machine gun aft by the depth charge station. The primary
object of the machine guns was for sinking floating mines.
The crews were kept in practice by firing at driftwood, floating
boxes, fish, etc. The 1-pdr. crews also engaged in this kind
of practice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Range Finders</span></h3>

<p>The range finders were mounted on the forward superstructure
just abaft and above the signal bridge. The large
range finder being mounted on a specially constructed stand
amidships between the port and starboard fire control stations,
and at a height of 124 feet above the water-line. Both control
stations were always within easy means of communication
with this range finder by means of voice tubes. The two small
range-finders were mounted on platforms—one on the outside
of each fire control station.</p>

<p>It is difficult to use the range finder against a periscope
for the simple reason that the periscope is visible for only a
short length of time, and is hard to get a quick reading on.
The range will have been obtained by spotting the shots before
the range finder can be brought into play. However, the range
finder would have been invaluable had we been attacked by
a raider, or a submarine on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ammunition</span></h3>

<p>The ammunition allowance for the ship was:</p>

<ul>
<li>1,200—6-inch shells, long point.</li>
<li>1,200—6-inch 50-cal. powder charges.</li>
<li>80—6-inch flat nose shells. (Non-ricocheting, for submarines when submerged.)</li>
<li>480—1-pdr. cartridges.</li>
<li>89,000—Cartridges, for .30-cal. rifle.</li>
<li>10,000—Cartridges, for .45-cal. automatic pistol.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, blank ammunition for rifles was
carried for training with ex-caliber.</p>

<p>Forty shells were carried in shell racks at the guns at all
times, and twenty rounds of powder at each gun while at sea.
The rest of the ammunition was carried in the magazines forward
and aft (seven decks below) and supplied to the guns
by means of elevators and ammunition parties.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gun Drills</span></h3>

<p>Gun and fire control drills were held daily to keep all
hands in practice. These drills were discontinued while in the
war zone. Actual conditions were simulated as much as possible
at all drills.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gun Watches</span></h3>

<p>When not in the war zone two guns forward (one on each
side) and two guns aft, were manned by a crew of six men at
all times, with a man at the telephones of each of the guns off
watch. The men off watch had to remain in the vicinity of
their quarters ready for instant call.</p>

<p>While in the zone all guns were manned by a crew of six
men with six men standing by in reserve. The guns were kept
loaded, both in and out of the zone, with powder and shell—ready
for instant firing by inserting a primer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lookouts</span></h3>

<p>Good lookouts are absolutely essential to a ship’s safety.
They have one of the most important positions on the ship. On
their alertness depends the discovery of any submarine or suspicious
object in his arc of lookout and the immediate and
accurate reporting of it to the fire control officer, so that the
guns may be brought into action in the quickest possible time
against the enemy.</p>

<p>There were twelve lookout stations on this vessel—six
on each side—so arranged that each lookout had an arc of
thirty degrees to keep under close observation. Of course there
were additional lookouts on watch at all times, such as the gun
crews, control officers, signalmen and officers-of-the-deck. Each
tried to be the first to spot a hostile periscope.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Personnel</span></h3>

<p>The personnel of the gun crews, lookouts, etc., showed
excellent qualities and sense of duty during the period of the
war. In all attacks by submarines, and false alarms, every
man performed his duties as he had been taught at drill,
showing no undue excitement, always on the job and ready for
more.</p>

<p>The letter from 6-inch gun crew No. 2 quoted below is
an example that well shows the spirit of the men.</p>

<p>The American Artillery referred to was the U. S. Naval

of Admiral Plunkett, United States Navy, and did great
credit to themselves and the naval service.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Target Practice</span></h3>

<p>Our first target practice was held November 27, 1917,
while returning from our trial trip to Guantanamo, Cuba.</p>

<p>During the time the ship was being prepared for sea at
Hoboken, little time was had for drills and preparing the gun
crews. However, they were all drilled in their various duties
and every effort was put forth to get them in shape.</p>

<p>The practice was held in a choppy sea with a stiff wind
blowing and an overcast sky, making it difficult to pick up the
targets—two spars, so weighted as to make them float upright.
Despite this handicap and the newness of the crews, an excellent
score was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Score</span></h3>

<p>Shots fired, 78; hits made, 63; percentage of hits, 75.42

<p>Our second target practice was held June 5, 1918, while
on our way from Brest, France, to New York. Spotters who
had had no previous experience at actual spotting were picked
to control the gun fire and made an excellent showing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Score</span></h3>

<p>The third and last practice was held on our way from New
York to Brest, France, on October 4, 1918. We had unfavorable
conditions as to weather and visibility. A high wind and
a large swell on the starboard quarter rendered the ship a most
unsuitable gun platform. The speed was twenty knots. However,
it proved valuable because of the difficulties to contend
with. In this practice, as in the second practice, new spotters
were put in control of guns in order to gain experience.</p>

<h3><i>The Electric Plant</i></h3>

<p class="author">W. S.</p>

<p>Lieutenant W. H. F. Schluter reported for duty July 29,
1917. The electrical plant at that date was in charge of Mr.
Joe. O’Donnell, head electrician, Navy Yard, New York. The
civilian force were scattered over the ship, tracing out and
locating circuits. This was a most difficult procedure because
there were absolutely no plans of circuits nor any descriptive
matter of electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>On August 13, 1917, the first Navy electrician reported
for duty and a few days later more reported. As soon as
enough electricians reported, the civilian electricians were
relieved from dynamo watch. Next the entire communication,
lighting and power details were taken over by the Navy electricians,
both regular and reserve.</p>

<p>When these details were arranged the Navy Yard electricians
were relieved from the maintenance of the plant and
attended to new installation and repair work only. It was at
this point where actual headway was made in preparing the
plant for sea, for under the former arrangement the Navy Yard
electricians could not devote their entire time to repair work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and new installation without being called off their job every
little while.</p>

<p>The co-operation between the civilian and enlisted electricians
was splendid and too much credit cannot be given to
these two classes of men. It was fine to see the spirit that
prevailed, for both were anxious to get the ship ready for sea.
To say that this called for good hard work, hour after hour
and day after day, is putting it mildly.</p>

<p>To describe in detail just how all this was accomplished
would fill a book in itself, but it may be grouped under the
following heading and then each group described in general
terms.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lighting, Ventilation and Interior Communication</span></h3>

<p>The first problem was light. To solve this so as to be able
to have battleship control, it was necessary to locate every light
on its proper circuit. There are about fifteen thousand lights,
controlled from eighty-one lighting or power stations and each
station containing from eighty, the highest, to ten the lowest,
local branch circuits, which in turn are supplied from seventy-six
main circuit switches and these again from eight main
switchboard feeder switches. When this lighting is distributed
over fourteen decks, of which the main deck, at sea level,
has an area of seventy-six thousand square feet, one may grasp
the magnitude of the problem attempted by these men. This
had to be completed without any wiring plans and without
interfering with the ship’s repair work of other departments.</p>

<p>To crown it all, along came the wreckers. That is, the
construction gang who stripped four decks of all room paneling.
If it had not been for the alertness and co-operation
of the electrical force, both civilian and enlisted, serious fires
would have surely resulted. As it was, not a fire alarm was
turned in during the entire reconstruction period, due to nothing
else except the alertness of these loyal men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tracing the Lighting Circuit</span></h3>

<p>During the day the electricians would search out lighting
stations, turn off lighting switches, test out circuits and do all
minor repair work. At night after the main working force had
knocked off, the electricians would muster in primary station
number two, main lighting distribution station. Then a main
distribution switch of either general lighting, police gangway,
or police cabin lighting would be cut off. Emergency lighting
was never cut out. The men would then leave in squads and
make note of what lighting was cut out and what remained in;
and in that manner the lighting control was traced down to such
a degree of safety that at dusk all lights that might be visible
to the enemy and at the same time provide sufficient lighting
for reasonable comfort for the crew and troops could be controlled
from one central lighting station and cut out in less
than a minute’s time.</p>

<p>The proof of how successfully this was accomplished, is in
the fact that during the entire period of the war, only one light
was reported visible by the escort and that was due to the carelessness
of a young officer who left a port open against orders.</p>

<p>Emergency lighting circuits were picked up by cutting
out all general lighting circuits and then marking all remaining
lights with a blue stripe. These circuits were then cut down
to bring them to a safe carrying capacity of a 110 volt, 140
ampere storage battery, which was installed for additional
safety in case of accident. These latter circuits were so
arranged that if for any reason the main supply should fail a
solenoid would automatically cut them in on the storage battery.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ventilation</span></h3>

<p>The next problem was the ventilation of the ship. There
are 113 ventilating blowers (51 exhaust and 62 supply) and
after all blowers were located the problem that remained was
to locate the compartment they ventilated. No plans were
available. This system was traced out by starting a blower
and then tracing up the ducts and recording the particular
section that it ventilated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Interior Communication</span></h3>

<p>All interior communication was traced out in the same
manner, <i>i. e.</i>, start from the transmitting apparatus and from
there on trace the piping and wiring until finally we arrived
at the receiving end. Then there were two Anshutz Gyro compasses,
which no one knew anything about, but here, again,
through the close co-operation of the Navy Yard force and the
ship’s electrical force, the secret of operating these compasses
was successfully solved.</p>

<p>To sum up the whole, one may say, it was the dogged
determination of the electrical forces, both civilian and enlisted,
who never gave in to any proposition that came before them,
that carried everything through to a successful issue.</p>

<h3><i>Steering Engine Data</i></h3>

<p class="author">E. P. H.</p>

<p>The control and manœuvering of a large ship such as
the <i>Leviathan</i> is a responsible job. This vessel’s steering
arrangement, or steering gear, is of steam engine type, connected
to a hydraulic telemotor. The gear is so easily manipulated
that a small boy standing on the bridge of this great
ship can control any course or given route that is desired to
be taken.</p>

<p>The engines, of which there are two, one port and one
starboard, are connected to the rudder head, which is approximately
thirty inches in diameter, by meshing into a huge
quadrant gear twenty-four feet in diameter. This gear secured
to the rudder head or stern is moved right or left, <i>i. e.</i>, starboard
or port, by a simple turn of a small steering wheel on the bridge.
This wheel is connected to the telemotor, which is simply a
hydraulic ram of two system pipe lines with plungers set amidships
when the rudder, engines, steering wheel and rudder
quadrant are in a neutral or center line position. The telemotor
is in the wheel house on the bridge approximately 800
feet from the steering engine, which is aft or at the stern of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the ship. Two small three-quarter inch copper pipe lines, one
port and one starboard, extend from bridge to steering engine
room and these little pipe lines are filled with a fluid mixture
of fifty per cent glycerine and fifty per cent water. When
the hand wheel on the bridge is moved, this forces the hydraulic
ram down or up, causing the fluid in pipes to open a control
valve on the steam steering engine operating this engine and
moving quadrant to right or left as desired.</p>

<p>This rudder and stem and steering engine quadrant are
the largest and most powerful installed on any vessel afloat.</p>

<h3><i>The Black Gang</i></h3>

<p class="author">BY ONE OF THEM—H. E.</p>

<p>The fire room boys of the <i>Leviathan</i> came from almost
every State in the Union. They worked hand in hand from about
August 1, 1917, until the end of the war. The success of the big
ship is due to their hearty co-operation. The part taken in the
war by the <i>Leviathan</i> is known the world over, and the spirit of
the “black gang” merits commendation and a chapter in this
book.</p>

<p>While in the dreaded war zone, trip after trip, these boys
plugged the fires, day and night, determined to beat Kaiser
Bill and fool the submarines. The submarine scare from time
to time aroused the firemen and the ship made far greater
speed than even the original contractors thought possible. The
pressure on the gauges at all times was on the blood mark.</p>

<p>The pass word throughout the fire rooms was: “Give her
hell, boys.”</p>

<p>At no time was there a boy or man who showed signs of
fear during any run, they had no time to think of “subs.”
Speed, chow and liberty in Hoboken was all we thought of.
Our work was hard and laborious, but no one grumbled.</p>

<p>Believe me, we had at first some ash-hopper installation.
The Germans who installed the outfit in these fire rooms should
have been made prisoners before the war started. Water in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
fire rooms was ankle deep. We were also obliged to use coal
from the barrows in charging the furnaces owing to the <i>Leviathan’s</i>
goat getter “flarebacks.”</p>

<p>“Split Hoof” Barnes, “Handsome” Hook, “Horse” Ross
and Gus Rush, the grouchy old chief water jerkers, made four
round trips, before either of them showed signs of a smile.
But they were far better off on this ship, wading in water up
to their knees, than they would be on many German ships
where the crew had to carry the ashes through the main dining
saloon to dump over the side. After a few trips with this installation
the whole system was thrown on to the Gladstone Dock
Piers in Liverpool, and a new style, such as human beings would
put in any sea-going ship, was installed. The Germans sure
are a funny people!</p>

<p>The fire rooms were touted later and all that was necessary
to make the fire rooms complete was a little plush furniture.
The boilers shaped up spick and span and the bilges were free
from water. With this accomplished real efficiency began.
The team work of firing the furnaces on bell signal caused
many witnesses to wonder in amazement. Boys who were away
from home for the first time stood manfully before the raging
fires and defied the intense heat in performance of their duty.</p>

<p>The average weight of these boys when reporting for duty
averaged about 130 pounds. Being bright and young, with
lots of pep, they grew strong and became efficient firemen.
The work seemed to agree with them, even if it was particularly
strenuous. In conclusion let us tell about “Wop”
Cariddo.</p>

<p>Cariddo was passing coal for seven and ten boilers in
number four fire room, as the ship was speeding through the
war zone on the 4 to 8 watch, when resting just inside the
bunker, one of the destroyers in our convoy, dropped a depth
charge just off our port beam. The report and jar of the
explosion caused the coal in this bunker to shift. “Wop” was
somewhat upset and surprised, but not frightened. He came
dashing out of the bunker. Old “Biff,” the “War Horse,” who
chanced to be passing through this fire room at the time grabbed
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by jumping around in this way?
Don’t you know that is a water-tight door on G-deck?</p>

<p>“It’s water-tight hell,” shouted the “Wop.” “I think that’s
what they call a ‘can,’ but I ain’t bluffed, I’m game. I just
want to stay with the boys a minute. Just give me a sandwich
and I will heave more coal out of that bunker than any five
boilers on this ship can burn”—and he did.</p>

<h3><i>Radio Data</i></h3>

<p class="author">G. A.</p>

<p>No original records or blueprints were found on the ship
for the radio equipment when she was taken over by the Navy.
This necessitated tracing out each and every individual circuit
and making blueprints of the same for future use. All apparatus
installed was of German make—Telefunken Wireless Telegraph
Company of Berlin. There were three complete telegraph
transmitters on board and three receivers. The large
transmitter was rated at ten kilowatts and was what is known
as an “undamped transmitter.” Under favorable atmospheric
conditions it was capable of working across the Atlantic and
has been known to do so.</p>

<p>During the three-year period of internment it had been
allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that it would have been
necessary to practically rebuild it in order to use it again.
The main trouble was caused by the salt water cooling system
eating its way through a galvanized iron case and getting into
the frequency transformer coils making them unfit for use.
It has not been used since. The second transmitter, known as
a five kilowatt quench gap set, did excellent work ever since
the ship was taken over. It is good for 1,200 miles under fair
conditions and has worked 2,200 miles. The third transmitter
is a one-half kilowatt spark coil set and can be used from the
ship’s power mains for short distances, or in case of emergency
(if the dynamos were not working for any reason), it can be
used from power supplied by storage batteries. Its radius is
about two hundred miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the original German receivers were kept, but one
was replaced by a later type U. S. Navy receiver. The ship was
never out of transmitting communication as the European
coast is picked up before the American coast is lost and vice
versa. The large transmitting stations of the United States and
Europe are copied from any part of the ocean. Honolulu,
a high powered station, has been copied while the ship lay in
Liverpool, England, a distance of approximately 8,000 miles.</p>

<p>When at sea we had special stations to copy on specified
schedules, so that messages to the ship from the United States
are copied when the ship is only a few hours from the European
ports. These messages are acknowledged after transmitting
communication has been established with the United States.</p>

<p>There are three antennæ, or aerials, two used for telegraphic
transmission and one for telephonic transmission. All
three are used for receiving. The radio telephone set has
been installed since the ship was taken over and is an American
invention. It is very effective up to twenty miles and has been
used to transmit a distance of thirty-six miles from this vessel.
It was used during the war for inter-communication among the
ships of a convoy or to and from the convoy and their escort,
and after the war was used for inter-communication between
ships lying in a harbor and the harbor station itself. This
eliminates interference with the main harbor station working
ships at sea. At the same time it allows the ships in the
harbor to work among themselves or communicate with the
shore. Prior to the telephone invention this work was done
by visual signal when the ships were within visual signal distance
with each other or the shore. When not so situated it
had to be done by boat, as so many ships using their telegraph
would have made it practically impossible for the shore station
to work ships at sea on account of the interference. The voice
over a radio phone has been proven to be clearer and more
distinct than over land line telephones.</p>

<p>On the <i>Leviathan</i> there are three operators and a messenger
on duty at all hours of the day and night when at sea. One
operator supervises the watch, two are constantly “listening in”
with telephones, and one man does the messenger work. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
“listening in” operators copy signals practically all the time
when on watch. Each has an antenna and a receiving set of
his own and listens on different wave lengths. Two messages
may be sent simultaneously, or two received simultaneously,
but it is not possible to send and receive at the same time. The
two receiving operators sit within a foot of each other, yet it has
happened more than once, that while one operator was copying a
message from Rome, Italy, at the same instant the other man
was copying a message from Balboa, Canal Zone. It is a common
occurrence for one operator to be copying a European
station while the other copies a United States station. The radio
force at present consists of one radio gunner, one radio officer,
one chief radio electrician and nine operators.</p>

<h3><i>The Engineering Department</i></h3>

<p class="author">By <span class="smcap">Commander Vaughn V. Woodward, U. S. N.</span></p>

<p>On July 26, 1917, the Commandant ordered me to report to
the <i>Vaterland</i> for duty, which I did, and on the above date the
vessel was commissioned. When I arrived on board, the engineering
department was in charge of the Shipping Board Engineers
and personnel. There had also recently arrived about 200
Navy firemen and a few petty officers; this was the total of Navy
engineering personnel on board. In company with one of the
junior engineers I went below for an inspection of the department.
During the next three days all my time was taken up
getting my bearings below and the layout fixed in my mind in
order to make out a station bill so that I could determine as
quickly as possible the personnel required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the third day I conveyed this information to
the Captain with the request that he bring pressure to bear on
the Bureau of Navigation to send our personnel, both officers
and enlisted men, as quickly as possible. The men and officers
began to arrive and by August 15th the last officer of the complement
had arrived. As each arrived he was put in charge
of a station and told to trace out his station, make a thorough
examination of the interior of all piping and machinery and
submit a report on repairs necessary and estimated time. Most
of my time during the day was spent below and the nights were
occupied drawing up station bills and handling the office
paper work, my only assistant being a reserve yeoman in the
service of the Shipping Board. I realized that, even at the
expense of time that should be spent inspecting repair work, I
must get my organization planned and laid out as quickly as
possible, and in operation. By August 5th all station bills and
organization had been completed and blueprinted and all officers
on board instructed. At this time, on account of report of
damage to machinery under repair on German ships by aliens,
I organized a secret service force below in an effort to detect
any attempts made to inflict damage. I purposely let the report
spread around among the civilian workmen that there was a
large force of government agents employed among them and
also in the crew. This seemed to have the desired moral effect,
because during the entire period there was but one case of
attempted malicious damage, which was discovered immediately.
An attempt had been made to thrust welding wire into
both of the L. P. astern turbines through the gauge line holes in
the flanges and thus damage the blading.</p>

<p>I will not go into details as to the condition of the
machinery, but will indicate some of the work done and the
changes made in order to get her ready for sea in the quickest
possible time. Most of the changes in design and arrangement
were made before her dock trial.</p>

<p>Each piece of machinery and boiler was opened up in all
its parts and thoroughly examined for foreign material or
damage. While open necessary repairs were made.</p>

<p>The joint on every auxiliary steam and exhaust line at
the piece of machinery was broken and steam blown through
before attempting to operate the machine: this to free the line
of foreign material.</p>

<p>All main, spring and thrust bearings were opened up,
examined, cleaned and realigned.</p>

<p>The float of the main thrusts were changed from .006 to
.015 inches to conform to U. S. Naval practice.</p>

<p>The rotors and casings of the four astern turbines were
all partially rebladed in place in the ship.</p>

<p>The dummy ring and piston were found broken in the port
H. P. astern; but these were renewed and machined in place,
the jacking engine turning the rotor while a cutting tool was
attached to the flange of the casting, thus making a lathe out of
the turbine and solving the practically impossible problem of
removing the rotor from the ship to be placed in a lathe ashore.</p>

<p>It was found that the impulse stages in this turbine had
been the cause of the damage to this dummy, so it was decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to remove the impulse stages entirely, which was done. This
decreases the economy of the turbine, but the safety guarantee
to the successful operation of this unit so far overbalanced this
factor that economy was sacrificed.</p>

<p>The starboard H. P. astern casing had several bad cracks
in both top and bottom, and from records on board had not
been in use on the last voyage of the vessel. This was in
process of being electrically welded when I reported on board.
The method in use, however, proved later on test, to give a faulty
weld, so that it was decided to cut a deep “V” groove in the
cracks and lace with steel studs, the lacing being filled in with
the weld, thus giving the weld holding power due to the welding
material fusing with the studs. This machine operated successfully
during the entire commission of the vessel with no signs
of ruptures or faulty welds.</p>

<p>On examination of the main throttles the starboard H. P.
astern throttle spool was found to be broken and off the stem.
This throttle was renewed and operated satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The system of automatic control of feed pumps in the
engine room by float and pressure control was decided on as
being highly dangerous, this system was at once removed and
hand control of pumps substituted.</p>

<p>After operating for some time it was found impossible
to obtain a vacuum that would afford economical operation for
a turbine plant. The capacities of the pumps and condensers
were computed and checked up and found adequate for the
horsepower to be handled. The low pressure system was then
tested out by water pressure and every noticeable leak stopped.
This however gave us no better results, the best vacuum we
could obtain averaging around 27 inches under normal operating
conditions. The question of the wet and dry suctions of
the pumps was next taken into consideration and it was
decided to blank the dry suction off from the condenser and
lead it into the wet suction of its own pump. This was done
and with the results desired. The vacuum desired can be
obtained at all times. With circulating water at forty degrees
a vacuum of as high as twenty-nine inches has been obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The average vacuum under all conditions obtained since this
change is about twenty-eight inches.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gland Steam Turbine Supply</span></h3>

<p>In order to further increase economy a radical change
was made in the method of supplying the turbines with gland
steam. As installed, all turbine glands required the use of
live steam, which with turbines of such large dimensions, was
quite an item. By a simple change in pipe leads and valves,
the leak off from the H. P. ahead glands, which formerly
led to the condenser, was piped to supply the glands of all
astern turbines and the I. P. and L. P. ahead turbines, thus
utilizing a three-inch line of steam which was formerly wasted
in the condenser. It is believed that this vessel is the only vessel
afloat that uses this system of gland steam.</p>

<p>The above concludes briefly a history of the major items
of alterations and repairs in the engine rooms.</p>

<p>In the fire rooms, all boilers were opened up and thoroughly
cleaned and all zincs removed. My attention was first
attracted by several burned boilers and next by the elaborate
system of automatic feeding of each individual boiler by means
of floats, levers, valves, etc. This system was at once dismantled,
removed from all boilers and scrapped. I then heard
reports that the Germans had experienced great trouble with
leaky tubes at the back ends of the boilers. Trams were at
once made and accurate measurements taken on the expansion
of the boiler between upper and lower drums on raising steam.
This was found to be quite excessive and greatest between the
back ends of the drums. After several experiments and
deductions from results obtained, it was decided to remove the
short circular internal feed in the front end of the steam drum
and fit a standard Navy internal feed pipe running the entire
length of the drum. This was done in all boilers and the
expansion was reduced about eighty per cent. Since her commission
we have never had to reroll a leaky boiler tube.
From commissioning to Nov. 11, 1918, there has been a total of
7,198 boiler steaming days, or an average per boiler of 156.5
days of 3,756 hours. Great care was exercised in the cleanliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the boilers and boiler water. No pits or corrosion
have been found in any part of the boilers.</p>

<p>On the first trip overseas great difficulty was experienced
in steaming, all boilers were in use and 144 revolutions per
minute was about the maximum speed we could maintain for
any length of time. There was an excessive amount of clinker
formation covering the grate bars. On diagnosing this trouble
and consulting standard works on combustion, air required per
pound of fuel, etc., it was decided that the grate bars did not
have sufficient air space. From computations made, a new
grate bar was designed with an increase in air space over the
old of thirty-five per cent. Our troubles in this line at once
ceased, and our trip home was made at 151 revolutions per
minute with forty-six boilers in use. Later we used thirty-eight
to forty boilers for as high as 154 revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>We experienced a great deal of trouble with the side brick
walls of the furnaces the first two trips, which required the
renewal of about 4,000 bricks each voyage. On being notified
that we would be required to start making quick turn-arounds
on the next voyage, I realized that this could not be done with
such an amount of brick work to be repaired. After many conferences
while at sea, we finally decided to tear all the brick
work out of one boiler and substitute cast iron liners, shaped
to fit the drums and punched with holes for ventilation. This
idea proved highly successful. All boilers were immediately
fitted likewise and all operated successfully. Besides the
elimination of the expense for the purchase of bricks and
cement, the labor and time of cleaning furnaces was reduced
ninety per cent. All that is necessary for cleaning and repairing
furnace walls at the present time is one man and a corn
broom.</p>

<p>The steaming efficiency has been greatly hampered at all
times by the flow of water over the fire room floor plates, due
to the faulty design of the German ash ejector. After many
attempts to remedy this by altering the design, we were finally
compelled to replace the hoppers with new hoppers of the See
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>There was at all times a great deal of trouble experienced
in carrying over water from the boilers to the turbines. The
water in the boilers was carried at the lowest level consistent
with safety, but in spite of this the trouble still continued. On
inspection of the main steam lines and boiler steam drums it
was found that they were practically bare of lagging. All
these lines and drums were immediately covered with two-inch
of magnesia eighty-five per cent pure, and all water trouble was
then eliminated. The water level in the boilers was also raised
from two to four inches, thus giving a greater factor of safety
here.</p>

<p>After several trips we noticed that the uptakes were excessively
hot and also that at times torching occurred at the stack
tops. This being a menace to the safety of the ship in the war
zone, it had to be remedied. After examining the uptake, furnaces
and path of gases we decided to alter the baffling. This
was done by installing flame baffles at the base of the uptake
in each boiler. It not only eliminated the torching, but also
decreased the amount of soot formation about fifty per cent.</p>

<p>This includes all the major items of the fire rooms. A
few general items follow:</p>

<p>An interesting phase of our overhaul was the method of
conducting our dock trial, after all repairs and tests to individual
main and auxiliary machinery had been completed. It
was realized that it was out of the question to attempt to turn
the engines over at a speed which could be called a fair trial,
for the reason that there was no mooring that could possibly
hold the ship at the dock. After lengthy conference with
officers, it was decided to break the tail shaft couplings and
jack the tail shaft aft about two inches to clear the line shafting.
This was done on each shaft and we ran each engine
individually for 4 hours up its designed speed 180 revolutions
per minute, then in manœuvering combination to full
speed, 119 revolutions per minute, then all four shafts in
cruising combination up to 180 revolutions per minute. The
dock trial proved a success from start to finish, no casualty
of any kind occurring. In this connection, in order to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a test on the boilers, No. 1 fire room was used the first day of
the trial, No. 2 the second day, No. 3 the third day, and No. 4
the fourth day.</p>

<p>During the period between August 15th and October 16th,
I can safely say that the officers and men of the department
averaged every day, Saturdays and Sundays, included, eighteen
working hours below without complaint or murmur. It seemed
to be a matter of great pride and determination with them.
We had heard many reports that the <i>Vaterland</i> would never
leave the dock, and many letters came threatening some officer
or man in the department. Of the men and petty officers we
were compelled to work with, I should say that twenty per cent
of them had never been on board a ship previous to their
reporting here. They were all recruits direct from recruiting
rendezvous, with the exception of a few C. P. O.’s who came
from the fleet. During all our overhaul and repair we had no
plans to guide us, all lines and arrangements had to be traced
out by the officer concerned, who submitted sketches to me.
These sketches have been forwarded to the Bureau of Steam
Engineering.</p>

<p>We found three logs made by the Germans on the <i>Vaterland.</i>
These logs, I believe were forwarded to Washington,
but to the best of my memory the speeds on these three trips
averaged for the entire voyage 22.4, 21 and something over 20
knots, with an average coal consumption per day of about
1,100 tons, running up to about 1,157 for one voyage. The
present consumption of this vessel at 20 knots is 816 tons per
day east bound, and 720 west bound. West bound we use
Welsh coal. We have never steamed at 22 knots for any period
long enough to obtain a point.</p>

<p>Going to Liverpool on a trip during an emergency she
maintained a speed of 181 revolutions per minute for a short
period of time until a slow bell was received.</p>

<p>Since the war service of the vessel started until November
11, 1918, the <i>Leviathan</i> has never had an engineering casualty
of any description, nor has the ship been delayed due to any
cause in the engineering department.</p>

<h3>The Medical Department</h3>

<p class="author">By <span class="smcap">Dr. Dunlap</span></p>

<p>The Medical Department is represented by the Senior
Medical Officer, Commander F. A. Asserson, M. C. U. S. N.,
four Junior Medical Officers with the rank of Lieutenant each,
one Chief Pharmacist, one Pharmacist, two Chief Pharmacist’s
Mates, and about one hundred and thirty Hospital Corpsmen.
There are also eight nurses, in charge of Miss Mary M. Robinson,
Chief Nurse, U. S. N. The units composing the Department
are as follows: Office of the Senior Medical Officer;
office of the Medical Officer of the Day; Major and Minor
Operating Rooms; Laboratory; Sick Officers’ Quarters of
ten beds; Medical and Surgical Wards with one hundred
and thirty-two beds; Isolation Ward with forty beds; total, one
hundred and eighty-two beds; Diet Kitchen; two Sick Call
Stations; Dispensary; Mental Ward; Guinea pig houses.</p>

<p>The history of this department dates from July, 1917,
when the first medical officers, Drs. F. J. Carroll, and E.
M. Hudson came aboard. These officers, both Lieutenants in
the U. S. Naval Medical Corps, were on duty at the U. S.
Naval Hospital in Brooklyn when our government assumed control
of the <i>Leviathan</i>, and they were ordered to report aboard
for duty. The vessel at that time being just as the Germans
had left her. Drs. Carroll and Hudson at once began tentative
plans for a medical department capable of handling the sick
among the thousands of troops the <i>Leviathan</i> was being rapidly
fitted to carry. Plans were drawn by them converting the social
hall on A-deck into wards and operating rooms. The orchestra
stage at the forward end of the hall was to be cut away, lowered
to the level of the deck and that space utilized as two operating
rooms with a sterilizing room. Wash rooms, toilets, linen
lockers, and an Isolation Ward were also provided for. Places
fore and aft were chosen as sick call stations and Dispensary.</p>

</div>

<p>On August 9, 1917, Commander John J. Snyder, M. C.
U. S. N., reported aboard as the first Senior Medical Officer.
The plans for the medical department were submitted to Dr.
Snyder and to the Naval Constructor, and were later adopted
by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Before the first trip
three more medical officers reported, viz: Lieut. Commander G.
T. Vaughan, U. S. N. R. F., Lieut. Max M. Braff, M. C. U. S. N.,
and Lieut. S. Strauss, M. C. N. N. V., so that on the first trip
there were five medical officers, besides the Senior Medical
Officer. After the trial trip to Cuba the <i>Leviathan</i> went to
Liverpool. The amount of work was found to be too much for
the number of doctors, and upon returning to the States another
Medical Officer was requested. Lieut. A. K. Dunlap, M. C.
U. S. N., was sent aboard in February, 1918, so that on the
second trip seven doctors were aboard. On subsequent trips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into New York, Lieut. Robt. Lorentz, M. C. U. S. N., Chief
Pharmacist C. I. Campbell, U. S. N. R. F., and Lieut. Edward
Crofutt, M. C. U. S. N., were sent aboard for duty. During
the month of May, 1918, Commander Snyder left to assume
his new duties as Fleet Surgeon, and his position on board as
Senior Medical Officer was assumed by Commander H. A.
May, M. C. U. S. N. Lieut. Harold Hulbert, M. C. U. S. N.,
and Pharmacist F. B. Redman also joined the ship about the
same time. Later in the summer the medical corps was further
strengthened by the addition of Lieuts. Harry L. Howell and
John E. Porter, U. S. Navy Medical Corps. In December, 1918,
Dr. May was detailed to duty ashore and the duties of Senior
Medical Officer assigned to Commander F. A. Asserson, M. C.
U. S. N. Lieuts. Walter L. Rathbun, Thos. Sheppard, and
A. T. Weston, M. C. U. S. R. F., reported at the same time. As
new officers reported on board from time to time, others were
relieved and detailed elsewhere. For the greater part of the
time since the ship has been in commission the medical department
has had nine doctors on board.</p>

<p>As the <i>Leviathan</i> transported nearly one hundred and
twenty thousand men to Europe during the war, and has brought
back nearly as many since, it requires no active imagination to
realize that the medical department has had its hands full.
The percentage of sickness bound to occur among thirteen
thousand men was enough to keep nine doctors busy, and this
was only a small part of their work. Sanitation on such a
huge ship was in itself a problem. Samples of food and water
had to be examined and accepted or rejected; troop compartments
and every nook and corner of the ship were inspected
daily and a high sanitary standard maintained; quotative
examinations of the air in the troop spaces were made at different
hours both day and night to determine the temperature,
humidity, and amount of carbon dioxide in these places; these
observations were made the subjects of various reports and
resulted in the installation of new ventilating systems and correction
of those already in operation; during threatened epidemics
of infectious diseases it was often necessary to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cultures and do other laboratory work among hundreds of men.
In July, 1918, the <i>Leviathan</i> began transporting wounded men
and has carried a large number of them to date. The wounded
required much attention and the manner in which they have
been cared for on board this vessel reflects great credit upon
the medical department.</p>

<p>A new departure for ships of war was the Nurse Corps.
The corps consists of Mary M. Robinson, Head Nurse, U. S. N.,
Irene Reed, U. S. N., Charlotte F. Hyde, U. S. N., Ruby F. Nutling,
U. S. N. R. F., Ruby Russell, U. S. N. R. F., Madelon
Stowell, U. S. N. R. F., Alice B. Newcomb, U. S. N. R. F., Vera
O. Harmon, U. S. N., Mary A. O’Neill, U. S. N. R. F. These
were the first nurses who ever had duty on a man-o’-war. Their
duties have been supervisory over the hospital corps, and their
training and experience as nurses have made them of invaluable
assistance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Influenza Epidemic</span></h3>

<p>The following are extracts from reports of the influenza
epidemic submitted to commanding officer by Lieut. Com. H. A.
May, M. C., October 11th, 1918:</p>

<p>There were 260 officers and 8,873 enlisted men of all
grades reported as present when the ship left the dock in
Hoboken. These made up the personnel of several organizations—the
323d Field Signal Corps, the 401st, 467th and
468th Engineers, the 302d Water Tank Train, a September
Automatic Replacement Draft, the 57th Pioneer Infantry, and
the 73d Medical Replacement Section. In addition, there were
191 members of the 60th and 62d units, Army Nurse Corps.</p>

<p>The ship sailed on September 29th. Because troop space
H-8 was deemed unfit for occupancy by reason of inadequate
ventilation, troops quartered there were moved on the 30th to
other compartments, causing congestion in many spaces. All
available bunks in the sick bay were filled by army sick before
the morning of September 30th. Arrangements were then made
to empty F room section 3, port side, containing 200 standees.
These bunks were filled within a few minutes with sick men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
picked up from the decks. When this space was found to be
insufficient E room section 2, starboard side, 415 bunks, was
vacated (October 1st), and the occupants sent down to H-8
regardless of improper ventilation. On October 3d, the port
side of E room section 2, 463 bunks, was vacated by the Army
guard, those sick in F. H. S. 3 were moved up to E. R. S. 2, and
the guard sent below to be scattered wherever they could find
space. Thus, on the night of October 3d, there was, beside the
sick bay, a ward on E-deck capable of bunking 878 men. As
the bunks are arranged four in a tier, one above the other,
the top bunk could not be used for the sick, except in emergencies,
because nurses could not climb up to them nor could
sick men climb down to go to toilets.</p>

<p>The Navy medical officers confined their efforts mostly to
those in the sick bay spaces, while all the sick quarters below
were turned over to the army medical officers. The army chief
surgeon, Colonel Decker, and two of his juniors became ill on
October 1st, leaving but eleven army doctors to hold sick call,
treat patients below, and care for about thirty nurses and twenty
officers who were ill in rooms. The navy medical officers stood
watches in E. R. S. 3 at such times as they could be spared
from the sick bay work, and relays of army nurses were assigned
to duty below, with the pneumonia cases in the isolation
ward, with sick officers in the officer’s ward, and with sick nurses
and officers in staterooms. In fact every available medical
officer, nurse and hospital corpsman was utilized to the extreme
of endurance. Below, in the E-deck ward, every possible
appliance for the care of the sick was furnished to the army
surgeons on duty. The commissary officer placed at our disposal
stewards, cooks and mess men, and furnished just the kind of
food required, in the best possible fashion. The Medical Department
of the ship owes, and I wish here to acknowledge, a
great debt of gratitude to the Commissary Department, and
to Paymaster Farwell and Chief Commissary Steward Flowers,
especially, for their co-operation in this matter, the success with
which they gave comfort and aid to the sick, and removed from
our shoulders the always worrisome burden of feeding men
unable to eat regular diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Course of the Epidemic</span></h3>

<p>This was influenced materially by these main factors:</p>

<p>First, the widespread infection of several organizations
before they embarked, and their assignment to many different
parts of the ship.</p>

<p>Second, the type of men comprising the most heavily
infected group. These men were particularly liable to infection.</p>

<p>Third, the absolute lassitude of those becoming ill caused
them to lie in their bunks without complaint until their infection
had become profound and pneumonia had begun. The
severe epistaxis which ushered in the disease in a very large
proportion of the cases, caused a lowering of resisting powers
which was added to by fright, by the confined space, and the
motion of the ship. Where pneumonia set in, not one man
was in condition to make a fight for life.</p>

<p>As noted above, the sick bay was filled a few hours after
leaving Hoboken. All pneumonia cases were placed in one
isolation ward at the beginning, and another isolation unit was
set aside for measles and mumps, both of which diseases were
present among the troops. The other isolation units were first
filled with influenza cases and later with pneumonias. Until
the fifth day of the voyage, few patients could be sent to duty
because of great weakness following the drop in temperature
as they grew better. Only the worst cases in E-deck ward were
sent to sick bay at any time, and all were potentially pneumonias.
The E-deck ward was more than full all the time and
there were many ill men in various troop spaces in other parts
of the ship.</p>

<p>There are no means of knowing the actual number of sick
at any one time, but it is estimated that fully 700 cases had
developed by the night of September 30th. They were brought
to the sick bay from all parts of the ship, in a continuous
stream, only to be turned away because all beds were occupied.
Most of them then lay down on the decks, inside and out, and
made no effort to reach the compartment where they belonged.
In fact practically no one had the slightest idea where he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
belong, and he left his blankets, clothing, kit, and all his possessions
to be salvaged at the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>During October 1st, every effort was made to increase
hospital space below, as noted above. The heretofore satisfactory
arrangements for army sick call were not adhered to by
the army medical officers, and hundreds of men applied for
treatment at the E-deck ward instead of going to the twelve
outlying sick call stations. On this day, Colonel Decker, the
Chief Army Surgeon, became ill. As he was the only army
medical officer who had had army experience in administrative
matters there was now no competent head to the army organization.
Two other medical officers also became ill and remained
in their rooms to the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of this day the E-deck ward was
opened on the starboard side and was filled before morning.
Twenty army nurses were detailed for duty during the night.
When patients were brought up, their mates carefully left their
blankets and clothing below and scouting parties had to be
sent through the compartments to gather up all loose blankets
for use of the sick. Fortunately we had about 100 army
blankets in the medical storeroom which had been salvaged on
other voyages. These were used while they lasted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Horrors of War</span></h3>

<p>The conditions during this night cannot be visualized by
any one who has not actually seen them.</p>

<p>The morning of October 2nd brought no relief. Things
seemed to grow worse instead of better. Cleaning details were
demanded of the army, but few men responded. Those who
came would stay awhile and wander away, never to be seen
again. No N. C. O.’s were sent, and there was no organization
for control. The nurses made a valiant effort to clean up and
the navy hospital corpsmen did marvels of work, but always
against tremendous odds. Only by constant patrolling between
the bunks could any impression be made upon the litter and
finally our own sailors were put on the job. They took hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
like veterans and the place was kept respectably clean thereafter.</p>

<p>The first death from pneumonia occurred on this day, and
the body was promptly embalmed and encased in a navy
standard casket.</p>

<p>When evening came no impression had been made upon
the great number of sick men about the decks and in their own
bunks. So arrangements were made to enlarge the hospital
space by including the port side of E. R. S. 2. On October 3rd
this was accomplished and from that time to the end of the
voyage we had enough bunks to accommodate practically all
the worst cases. Three deaths occurred this day and all were
embalmed and encased. After going through the hospital and
troop spaces that night it was estimated that there were about
900 cases of influenza in the ship. In the wards we sent back
to bunks below all men whose temperature reached 99 and
kept all bunks filled with cases of higher fever.</p>

<p>October 4th, seven deaths during the day. The sea was
rough and the ship rolled heavily. Hundreds of men were
thoroughly miserable from seasickness and other hundreds who
had been off the farm but a few weeks, were miserable from
terror of the strange surroundings and the ravages of the epidemic.
Dozens of these men applied at the wards for treatment
and the inexperience of army doctors in the recognition
of seasickness caused a great many needless admissions to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Many officers and nurses were ill in their rooms, and
required the constant attention of a corps of well nurses, and
an army medical officer to attend them.</p>

<p>Each succeeding day of the voyage was like those preceding,
a nightmare of weariness and anxiety on the part of
nurses, doctors, and hospital corpsmen. No one thought of bed
for himself and all hands worked day and night. On the 5th
there were 10 deaths, on the 6th there were 24, and on the
7th, the day of arrival at our destination, the toll was 31.
The army ambulance boat was promptly alongside, and debarkation
of the sick began about noon. The sick bay was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
cleared first and we at once began to clean up in preparation
for the wounded to be carried westbound. E-deck was then
evacuated, but all the sick could not be handled before night,
about 200 remaining on board.</p>

<p>On the 8th these were taken off by the army, but not before
fourteen more deaths had occurred. Although on this day
almost the entire personnel (army) had gone, the nurses
remained until the last sick man was taken off.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pneumonia</span></h3>

<p>It is the opinion of myself and the other medical officers
attached to the ship that there were fully 2,000 cases of influenza
on board. How many developed pneumonia there are
no means of knowing. Over 75 cases of the latter disease were
admitted to the sick bay, most of them moribund. Of these, 3
improved so much that they went back to their compartments,
29 were transferred to hospital ashore, and about 40 died.
As the records required to transfer patients from the army to
the navy medical officers were furnished in but few cases, and
as my records embrace all the dead, I had no means of knowing
how many died in the sick bay and how many in the E-deck
ward. Cases of pneumonia were found dying in various parts
of the ship and many died in the E-deck ward a few minutes
after admission. Owing to the public character of that ward,
men passing would see a vacant bunk and lie down in it without
applying to a medical officer at all. Records were impossible,
and even identification of patients was extremely difficult
because hundreds of men had blank tags tied about their necks.
Many were either delirious or too ill to know their own names.
Nine hundred and sixty-six patients were removed by the army
hospital authorities in France.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Deaths</span></h3>

<p>Ninety-one deaths occurred among the army personnel,
of whom one was an officer, as follows:</p>

<p>The sick officer was treated in the open air on B deck, had

<h3><span class="smcap">Hospital Corps</span></h3>

<p>I cannot speak in terms of sufficient commendation of the
work of the hospital corps of this ship. Every man was called
upon to exert himself to the limit of endurance during the entire
round trip. No one complained, every man was on the job.
Many of them worked twenty-four hours at a stretch amid
conditions that can never be understood by one ashore or on a
man-of-war. Some of the embalming detail, worked at their
gruesome task forty-eight hours at a stretch without complaint,
and at the end I had to drive them away to a bath and bed.</p>

<p>I have learned that the following named men of the Commissary
Department voluntarily remained on duty with the
sick on E-deck during the entire voyage.</p>

<h3>Commissary Department</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Feeding the Troops</span></h3>

<p class="author">F. L. F.</p>

<p>As soon as the decision was made that the Navy would
have charge of the commissary departments on the transports,
plans were promptly made to effect the most complete and
satisfactory arrangements for the subsistence of the troops
en route. A board of three expert commissary officers was
appointed with instructions to prepare a well-balanced standard
bill-of-fare for use on board all of the transports. The bill-of-fare
for a fourteen-day period submitted by the board, was
approved and copies forwarded to the commanding officers
of all transports for their guidance with the request that it be
followed as nearly as possible. Experienced officers of the
Supply Corps were then recommended for assignment to the
transports and nothing was left undone which would contribute
in any way to perfect arrangements for the satisfactory feeding
of the troops. This work was new to the navy, as transports
were heretofore operated exclusively by the army.</p>

<p>On this account and because, as stated by the Secretary
of the Navy, “The success of the transfer of the army troops
will depend to a large extent on the conduct of the commissary
service on each vessel.</p>

<p>“It is especially gratifying to be able to report that the
subsistence of the troops en route overseas has been satisfactory
in every respect. This fact is confirmed by reports received
from time to time.”</p>

<p>This extract from the Paymaster General’s report marks
the success of the enormous task given the Bureau of Supplies
and Accounts of feeding the A. E. F. while being carried overseas
on American transports.</p>

<p>The menus mentioned in the report actually originated
from the <i>Leviathan</i>, and the general instructions at that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
were to “live up to the standard required by the sample menu,
and to do better, if possible.” This was the slogan of all the
general messes in the transport service, and it is a well-known
fact that the army as a whole has had nothing but praise for
the Navy Commissariat.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i>, being the largest carrier of all the transport
fleet, naturally placed the supply officer, Paymaster Geo. C.
Schafer and his assistants, headed by H. B. Judkins, Ensign,
U. S. N. R. F., Pay Corps, on their mettle to make a success of
this enormous undertaking, although at that time and even up to
the time the first meal was served to the troops, the huge task
was hardly realized.</p>

<p>During the period of fitting out and on the first trip, there
were only five men in the Commissary Department who were
known to be familiar with the navy general mess requirements
and navy discipline, the rest of the Commissary Department
was made up from men taken from all walks of life—lawyers,
college men, horseshoers, business men, actors, etc.; only about
thirty men having any experience as cooks and bakers, and
among these only a comparative few who had any seagoing
experience. Even these men were of an unknown quantity until
tried out, in the actual experience of cooking and serving food
to 10,000 troops and crew, the proportionate number carried
the first trip through the war-zone. This was the biggest feeding
task ever undertaken in the history of the maritime world.</p>

<p>These men came from various sources of recruiting, mostly
from the headquarters and commissary schools connected with
the Third Naval District, arriving in batches of one to ten almost
every day until ready to sail. None of them came fully
equipped or uniformed and the first real muster of the Commissary
Department was unique in the history of the ship, about
three hundred men falling in on B-deck. An attempt was made
to drill them into something near the navy standard. At that
time it seemed a hopeless task—none seemed to know what was
required of them, even to the simple movement of opening ranks
for inspection. The inspection was a joke, no one in uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and the expression “Coxey’s Army” would describe the general
appearance of the men.</p>

<p>However, the spirit was there, and in an incredibly short
time the men were properly uniformed and at the first crew
inspection made a very creditable showing, even in the opinion
of the old-timers.</p>

<p>Most of these men had the American knack of adaptiveness
and soon fitted into the duties required of them; showed such
a splendid desire to make good that after the first trip we were
able to compare the Commissary Department, and by no means
discreditably, with that on the huge British transports, <i>Olympic</i>
and <i>Mauretania</i>.</p>

<p>The system steadily improved, and it is safe to assume
that we are unexcelled by any other similar sea-going
organization.</p>

<p>Because of the “training afloat” system laid out by the
Navy Department it is estimated that about 100 trained men
have left the <i>Leviathan</i>, trained by actual experience in cooking
and baking, thus giving the growing navy a trained personnel,
not only cooks and bakers, but American man-o’-war’s men,
developed as such by the stern requirements of war conditions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Horseshoer Thinks Cooking Easy</span></h3>

<p>Each man reporting aboard was required to fill out a questionaire
blank stating experience, etc. This was done so that
men could be placed to the best advantage in the galley, bakery,
storerooms and offices. Some of the answers were laughable.
For instance, one stated that his sole experience was cooking
for his sisters when mother was obliged to go out. Another had
been a horseshoer for about eighteen years, another had no
experience, but he knew that cooking was very easy to learn
and that he was there for that purpose. One man made a
strong bid for the billet of head waiter and informed the Commissary
Steward that if he gave him the job he would send at
once to Chicago for his Tuxedo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Secret Service Interested</span></h3>

<p>During this time it was well known that the German Secret
Service was much interested in the <i>Leviathan</i> and for that
reason all new arrivals were carefully watched. One suspicious
commissary recruit was picked out and turned over to the authorities.
He was so clearly German, both in speech and
appearance, that it would have been impossible for him to
get by, and although nothing was heard of his fate, it is safe
to assume that he was interned in a safe place until the end
of the war.</p>

<p>The actual fitting out was a tremendous problem, most of
the German kitchen machinery and utensils were found either
in bad condition or useless for the coming needs and almost
a new installation was built, using, however, the German kettles
and ranges when possible, discarding anything not absolutely
essential. It was often a matter of considerable thought and
discussion to decide what should be kept and what discarded.</p>

<p>There were found on the ship seven complete kitchens,
counting the two Jewish kitchens which were designed for
Kosher cooking. These were intended to provide for the large
number of Jewish immigrants carried over in the third class or
steerage compartments and all these galleys had been splendidly
fitted out to care for about 5,000 passengers and 1,000
crew. As the problem was to prepare for about 15,000 it can
be readily seen that some drastic changes were required.</p>

<p>In connection with this it might be well to state that the
first letter written about commissary affairs asked that 27 steam
kettles of 100 gallons capacity, 3 dough mixers of two barrel
capacity, and 7 navy standard bake ovens be obtained. These
were installed in addition to the German equipment left, after
the rip-out period was finished.</p>

<p>All except the first and second class galley were dismantled.
All the kettles and one large electric bake oven were
installed in the first class galley compartment, thus consolidating
the cooking machinery in the present spaces which were
renamed the Troop Galley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>On E-deck aft, the third class galley was ripped out and a
blacksmith and coppersmith shop installed. The third class
dining room, later the engineer’s force mess room, became temporarily
the crew mess room until the number became too large
and the first class saloon was used until the deck force quarters
were fitted up. It was during this time that a large number of
the crew were ptomaine poisoned by eating hash that was prepared
from infected corned beef, probably made so by defective
tinning. The entire Medical Department was busy all that day,
but luckily no lives were lost. The rumor leaked out that in
some way “Fritz” had got in some fine work, but this was denied
upon investigation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Storage</span></h3>

<p>Another phase of the preparation presented itself, the
storage of provisions. The combined experience of the leading
men in the department was brought into play to solve the many
problems involved, to provide for storing and keeping of over
two millions of pounds of provisions in the space allotted. The
principal items and their quantities required for this loading
were as follows: 200,000 lbs. of flour, 60,000 lbs. tinned
meats, 25,000 lbs. salt meats, 120,000 lbs. smoked meats, 260,000 lbs.
fresh meats, 25,000 lbs. turkey and fowl, 30,000 doz.
eggs, 140,000 lbs. beans, 75,000 tinned vegetables, 420,000
fresh vegetables, 22,000 cereals, 145,000 dried, tinned and
preserved fruits, 175,000 fresh fruits, 40,000 lbs. coffee, 3,000
lbs. cocoa, 2,500 lbs. tea, 60,000 evaporated milk, 5,000 qts.
fresh milk, 5,000 qts. of cream, 40,000 lbs. fresh butter,
15,000 lbs. of lard, 15,000 lbs. salt, 175,000 lbs. of sugar.</p>

<p>These quantities were estimated to subsist 10,000 troops
twenty-five days and 1,400 crew one hundred and twenty days.</p>

<p>Careful consideration had to be given to the location, size,
drainage and estimated temperatures of the various storerooms
and cold storage. Also the items of provisions and quantities
of each item required and the storeroom best adapted by size
and accessibility. This was worked out so successfully that
when the actual provisioning was finished only about five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
packages were left out of the allotted spaces due to the
fact that at the last moment, passages had to be left in several
rooms to give access to manhole plates leading into the double
bottoms.</p>

<p>The cold storage spaces were an unknown quantity, only
uncertain data (not from German sources) being available concerning
the temperatures of the various compartments. However,
this part of the provisioning was also successfully finished
and it might be well to state that since the first loading, to the
end of hostilities, only about 3,000 pounds of meats, and 6,000
pounds of fruits and vegetables were lost through deterioration.</p>

<p>Enough provisions were carried in the ship to approximate
the supply of ten battleships and one supply ship. This comparison
was often used when explaining to distinguished guests
the enormous size of the <i>Leviathan’s</i> larder.</p>

<p>During this phase of the work great consideration was
given to the method of issuing the food to the individual soldier.
No data was obtainable except the general requirements of the
army regulation. How to make these requirements fit into the
planned system of feeding was a problem, which however was
so successfully solved that the <i>Leviathan</i> system of issue was,
either in whole or in part, practically adopted for all transports.</p>

<p>The general scheme is an elaboration on a rough, but
efficient system of feeding landing forces of sailors at Guantanamo,
where it was the custom to land the various ship battalions
and go into camp at Deer Point for small arms practice.</p>

<p>The equipment then was a limited one, namely, a mess table
at the foot of each company street and four syrup barrels
filled with soap and water for washing the mess gear. From
this crude idea was built up a system that operates as follows:</p>

<p>In the after end of the troop mess hall are placed twelve
tanks fitted with direct steam jets. These tanks have specially
fitted tops and are capable of holding eight insets or food containers,
each container holding about seventy pounds of food
or coffee. The steam jet is turned on when the tank is filled
with the food containers, thus enabling the food to be placed
ready for serving, some time before the messing, keeping the
food warm and palatable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>This tank, or serving station, contains such items of the
meal as meats, gravy, vegetables and beverages. In addition to
each serving station is an auxiliary serving table from which is
served, bread, butter and desserts. Each serving station and
table has a detail of four men and a messing sergeant who
draws the food from the galley and serves to the men as they
file past their particular station.</p>

<p>The men march from their compartments under control of
their compartment officer in four lines, two from forward and
two from aft, meeting on E-deck at the grand staircase leading
into the troop mess hall coming down the staircase four abreast.
When in the mess hall the column is split into twelve lines and
pass the serving stations at a slow walk through to the mess
tables. When finished, they go on to the forward end of the
mess hall, where there are the washing tanks somewhat similar
to the tanks at the serving stations. These tanks have hot soapy
and clear water in which the men wash and rinse their mess
gear, returning to their compartments by other established
routes. All the mess lines, both to and from the mess, are kept
under control so that in case of an emergency during the messing
the men may be brought to their proper stations quickly
and without confusion. This arrangement of the messing lines
and mess hall has kept intact and separate the feeding space of
the troops from their sleeping quarters, an arrangement of
much sanitary value and in evidence only upon United States
Navy transports.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">World’s Feeding Record</span></h3>

<p>The system holds the world’s record for feeding the largest
number of men in the shortest period of time, ashore or afloat.
Nine thousand men in an average time of ninety minutes were
fed. The best time, however, for the same number of men was
sixty-seven minutes; this means that during the messing one
soldier was served a ration every thirty-six seconds.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that these huge commissary problems
has been solved with deep thought and precision, overcoming
the enormous difficulties presented on shipboard by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
confined space and the mass of floating population equal that
of a large town or small city.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of December 14th, the day previous to
the starting on that historical first trip, the first meal was served.
Previous to serving this meal, the carefully planned organization
had to be put into operation. This required numerous
army details for messing, kitchen work and working parties.
These reported to the commissary office and after being properly
stationed were given instructions to carry on the messing.</p>

<p>This was done about two hours after the troops were embarked
and the mess movement was started in the troop mess
hall. There were many hitches in the mess movement to the
serving stations, but all the troops were fed in about two and
one half hours and after the second day the messing organization
“shook down” so well, that the Commissary Department
was able to report that the messing system was a success. In
fact, the first meal had not been going ten minutes when it was
realized, much to the relief and joy of those who had worked
so hard on the fitting out the messing organization, that the
system planned was very effective. One strict rule had to be
made in connection with the embarkation, which was that no
meals would be served until all messing details were stationed,
and although it seemed harsh, an amusing incident proved its
value. Soldiers are akin to sailors, inasmuch as they are blessed
with healthy appetites, so that invariably when troops arrive
aboard they are hungry, and if not restrained naturally gravitate
to the kitchen. The first troops aboard followed their natural
instincts and wormed their way into the galley. Their tales of
hunger told to the sailor-cooks in the galley so worked on their
sympathies that a relief party began issuing sandwiches. In a
few minutes by some mysterious way the good news was passed
that the good-natured sailors were handing out “chow” and in
about ten minutes a thousand hungry troopers were crowded
into the galley clamoring for “eats.” The resulting confusion
almost upset the embarkation and a hurried S. O. S. to the
army headquarters was made to get the soldiers to clear the
galley. It is needless to say that the galley cooks never allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
their good nature to get the best of them again during other
embarkations.</p>

<p>Although the start was splendid it must not be thought
that it was plain sailing on following days for the Commissary
Department. In fact, it was much to the contrary and the
men who had the responsibility of the undertaking speak of
that trip as a nightmare.</p>

<p>The winter days were short and war conditions required
that nearly all lights, inside the ship and out, must be extinguished
one hour before sunset. This condition meant that
most of the work had to be done in almost total darkness. No
refuse could be disposed of until one hour after sunset and all
wood had to be burned. The men detailed for this purpose
were compelled to grope their way about a strange ship in the
dark.</p>

<p>The galley and bake shop were conducted under much the
same conditions, but the troops were fed. The <i>Leviathan’s</i>
standard bill-of-fare was carried out in every detail.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Who Said Pie?</span></h3>

<p>Because the <i>Leviathan</i> was expected to arrive in port
on Christmas eve, a regular navy holiday dinner with all the
fixings was given to all hands on the day before. This dinner
was given complete and went off smoothly with but one hitch.
As said before, soldiers have healthy appetites and a strong
affection for pie, and, in order to get more pie than their share,
a great many doubled back in the mess lines and perhaps more
than once, for there were over 15,000 rations of pie served out
on that strenuous day. For a while it looked as if we were
going to be overwhelmed and that the last thousand troops to
go through the mess lines would not get any holiday dinner, but
a good substitute dinner was provided and it is recorded that
everybody was made happy.</p>

<p>All this work was accomplished under such adverse conditions
and with the added strain incidental to our first trip
through the war zone, that it was with relief we arrived in port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and fed the soldiers their last navy meal alongside the landing
stage in Liverpool. Each man leaving the ship was given a
lunch to stay him on the next stage of his journey and with
it went the good wishes of the <i>Leviathan’s</i> crew. The practice
of providing a lunch to debarking troops has been carried out
in all succeeding disembarkations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Improvements</span></h3>

<p>The big feat was accomplished and the rest given by the
necessarily long stay in Liverpool was well earned and enjoyed.
As a result of the experience of the trip, many improvements
were made in the messing organization and galley installation,
the most noteworthy of which was the abandoning of the galley
forward, moving the kettles, etc., to the troop galley and giving
up the two other mess hall spaces for berthing—messing all the
troops in the present large mess hall. This brought about a
consolidation of the general mess and made the task easier.</p>

<p>Subsequent trips saw consistent improvement until a new
record was established during the thirteenth trip when about
eleven thousand home-coming troops were fed in seventy-six
minutes best time and an average time of about ninety minutes.
Over 150,000 overseas troops have been fed on the <i>Leviathan’s</i>
trips and the good ship’s commissariat has become famous
wherever the A. E. F. have gone. The <i>Leviathan’s</i> apple pie
has been, to quote a returning wounded soldier, placed second
in popularity with the justly famous Salvation Army doughnut.</p>

<p>The success of the first trip was undoubtedly due to the
earnest work of all hands under the able direction of Paymaster
Simon Pietri, Supply Officer and Assistant Paymaster
H. B. Judkins. The work in the galley was ably directed by
ship’s cook 1st class, later Chief Commissary Steward, Martin
J. Flynn, and it can be said without fear of contradiction, that
the entire success of the enormous undertaking depended largely
on his splendid judgment and ability. This must in justice
also be said of Chief Commissary Steward W. J. Linn, who took
entire charge of the stores and whose long and varied commissary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
experience helped us over difficulties which at times
seemed unsurmountable.</p>

<p>Subsequent trips under the direction of Paymaster Farwell
and Paymaster Edwards, his successor and present Supply
Officer, have brought in their wake many improvements so that
now the <i>Leviathan’s</i> Commissariat is considered the standard of
its kind.</p>

<h3>The Supply Department</h3>

<p class="author">G. F. P.</p>

<p>“When do we eat? When’s pay day? When can I draw a
pair of shoes? Got any ‘Bull’-an’ soap-an’ peanut brittle? Can
you get us a piano, an anchor, a car of lumber and a dozen 13
inch gadjets before we shove off?”—questions that are part of
the sailors’ existence and the cause of the Supply Officer’s
dilemma.</p>

<p>How well they are answered speaks volumes for the organization,
zeal and efficiency of the Supply Department. To feed
fourteen thousand men (and a thousand or so women, generals,
admirals, diplomats, lieutenants and bo’sns); to operate canteens
throughout the ship that rival in their activities Woolworth’s
chain of stores; to keep the storerooms stocked with
every conceivable kind of supplies which are or may in any
emergency be required in the many departments of the ship; to
clothe properly the crew of more than two thousand men; to
keep the accounts of these men and to pay them twice a month;
to—but limited space does not permit. Enough to state that the
patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon, the agility of Mercury
and the persistency of Bryan are among the requirements necessary
to manage successfully the diversified activities of the
Supply Department. Verily, the life of the Supply Officer is
far from being a bed of roses.</p>

<p>Five distinct divisions of the Supply Department were
organized during the early days of going into commission—Commissary,
Disbursing, Sales, Storekeeping, and Officers’
Mess—each in charge of an Assistant Supply Officer. The original
plans of organization and operation, evolved by Captain
G. C. Schafer, were developed and carried out by Lieut.-Comdr.
F. Simonpietri, upon whom rested the responsibility of filling
the office of Senior Supply Officer on the <i>Leviathan’s</i> maiden
trip with more than ten thousand men on board. Under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
able guidance the routine of the various divisions were systematized,
improved and proven. Each subsequent trip brought
forth new problems which were masterfully dealt with and
solved by Lieut.-Comdr. Simonpietri and his able successors,
Lieut.-Comdr. N. B. Farwell and Lieut.-Comdr. E. C. Edwards.
A silent tribute to the results achieved by these Supply Officers
is the fact that to the large transports commissioned later the
<i>Leviathan</i> was called upon to furnish many trained men as a
nucleus for the Supply Departments of these new ships, where
<i>Leviathan</i> methods were introduced and are being successfully
carried out.</p>

<p>During the early voyages Assistant Supply Officers Colburn,
Barker, Poggi, Waters and Judkins wrestled with their
respective divisional duties by day, and by way of diversion
alternated as Senior Lookout Officers by night, making hourly
rounds of the lookout stations, from the forepeak to the after
crow’s-nest, fair weather and foul. Inclined a bit toward
rotundness, it was a ne’er to be forgotten privilege to see the
form of “Jeff” Colburn silhouetted against the starry heavens,
en route to the crow’s-nest. “Behold!” quoted “Doc” Carroll
one cold evening, when he espied “Jeff’s” figure looming in
the shrouds like a square-rigger, “behold yon sylph-like Romeo
seeking his fair Juliet!”</p>

<p>Other assistant supply officers who have been assigned to
the <i>Leviathan</i> for duty or instruction are Messrs. Carter,
Wrigley, Bishop, Harris, Schuler, Hoffman, O’Shaughnessy,
Stevens, Ingram, Finstemacher and Miller. Of the “old timers”
but Waters and Poggi remained to continue “carrying on” in
charge of the Storekeeping and Sales Divisions respectively.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sales Division</span></h3>

<p>The Sales Division comprises live ship’s stores (canteens)
and the clothing and small stores issue room. With troops on
board, the canteens, which are located in accessible parts of
the ship, make approximately ten thousand separate sales each
day, with a total daily cash receipt of about $5,000. The
largest day’s business amounted to $6,498, another record to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
be added to the many laurels already won by the Rainbow
Division, units of which were being transported at the time.
As one of the canteen storekeepers put it, “If those Rainbows
can fight like they can spend, I’d like to see them in action!”</p>

<p>On the shelves of these canteens may be found the usual
line of necessities—and luxuries—carried in all Navy canteens,
but in unusual quantities; from the most commonplace pair
of shoe laces to the most dainty package of bon-bons. Naturally,
a vast amount of small items must be handled to make up
$5,000 worth of daily sales. And these sales are made, not
in leisurely lady-like fashion, over counter and show-case, but
through the canteen window to a never-ending line of clamoring
sailors and doughboys by but five storekeepers—one to each
canteen. These five “salesmen,” especially selected and trained
for this type of duty, wait on more “customers” in a day, it
is believed, than any other sales people in existence, including
the busiest dispenser of wet-goods on Broadway during that
torrid spell just prior to July 1st, 1919.</p>

<p>In view of the reported atrocious activities of the Hun
in our country during the war, every precaution was taken to
procure uncontaminated supplies for use of the crew and troops.
As a safeguard, samples of edible stores taken on board were
submitted to Surgeon Dunlap for examination in the ship’s
laboratory.</p>

<p>While the duties of the sales force are necessarily active
and exacting, discretion and tact are exercised in handling such
a large body of waiting “customers,” which accounts for the
fact that errors and “kicks” are few and far between.</p>

<p>In studying the likes and dislikes of the troops being transported,
in order to ascertain the varieties and quantities of
canteen stores to carry for sale, it was readily discovered that
tastes of the various units differ as widely as do their geographic
origins. Hence, when a division that originated in Dixie embarks,
peanut candy to the tune of from six to eight tons will
be consumed during the voyage, together with prodigious packs
of cigarettes; when a mid-western outfit takes passage, peanut
candy and cigarette sales fall off, but large inroads are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in the stock of chocolates, chewing tobacco and Navy postcards;
when far westerners like the Sunset Division come aboard
mountains of “Bull Durham,” brown cigarette papers, caramels
and playing cards are broken out of the store rooms, for the
boys of the West are not strong for chocolate and peanut candy,
though they do “roll their own” and wear out the ship’s police
force by endeavoring to keep pinochle games going in every
conceivable part of the ship. But regardless of geographic
origin, stormy weather creates desires much akin to all doughboys—a
desire to lay off such joys as chocolates, bon-bons and
poker; a desire to be left alone, not too far from the out board
rail, with a package of that wonderful panacea, lemon drops,
of which as many as three tons will be consumed during a
particularly stormy crossing. During a bit of heavy weather,
one of the ship’s wits, feigning much excitement, rushed into a
group of forlorn sea-sick warriors, to inform them that “Here
comes a torpedo—straight for us!” “Thank God,” came the
answering chorus.</p>

<p>Aside from the fifteen tons of various candies loaded in
Hoboken, each trip witnesses the consumption of approximately
two hundred thousand cigarettes, twenty thousand cigars, three
thousand packages of Bull Durham and eleven thousand pieces
of soap.</p>

<p>The Clothing and Small Stores issue to the crew about
nine thousand dollars’ worth of wearing apparel monthly. This
active branch of the Sales Division carries a stock of supplies
valued at fifty thousand dollars—from three cent spools of
thread to twenty dollar overcoats. For the hard to fit and the
Beau Brummel C. P. O.’s, the made-to-measure business is no
small item.</p>

<p>The total annual business done by the Sales Division—sales
to the crew and troops, including transfers of stores to
other ships and stations in Europe, amounts to nearly half a
million dollars. All items handled by the ship’s stores are
sold at cost, with but a very small margin of profit. In some
instances the selling price is lower than the cost. It is endeavored
to make not over ten per cent profit, the money thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
accumulated going to the entertainment fund, which provides
the means of entertaining the crew and troops with movie shows
each night, and various other activities and equipments which
are necessary to keep the boys amused and happy. The Disbursing
Division of the Supply organization is just what the
name implies, and expends more real cash than a flock of
youthful Pittsburgh millionaires. Besides paying the volumes
of never-ending bills for never-ending supplies used on board,
the pay roll of the ship’s officers and men are kept by the yeomen,
who comprise the personnel of this division. The Disbursing
Officer peels off seventy thousand cold iron men each
pay day, which happens twice a month. Pay day, the day the
Eagle does his big stunt, to the sailors is “Der Tag.” The
annual wages paid to the ship’s company approximates one
million eight hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The Storekeeping Section procure and carry in stock all
the varied supplies used on board for the operation and maintenance
of the ship. The store-rooms are veritable storehouses,
stocked with every conceivable kind of supplies from deck
swabs to grate bars.</p>

<p>One of the chief difficulties encountered during the early
days was to find spare parts for the German electrical equipment.
Our American standard equipment does not fit the
German installations, and unless spares could be obtained the
whole electrical system would have to be replaced with standard
American fittings. Fortunately, there was quite a stock of
German equipment remaining in England since the pre-war
days. This had been carried in stock for the use of German
ships calling at English ports. Practically all of this stock
was purchased by the <i>Leviathan</i>, and was sufficient to run the
ship until our own factories could be equipped to turn out this
type of supplies and equipment. When the Army, Navy Yards
and Shipping Board were clamoring for supplies, the task of
procuring stock in quantities demanded by such a huge ship
was indeed a difficult one. Thanks to the loyal co-operation
of New York and New Jersey business men, and the Naval
Commandeering Board, sufficient quantities of supplies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
secured to keep going. A typical example of the difficulties
encountered can be illustrated by the activity necessary to equip
the ship’s hospital. The market was bare of such supplies,
due to the incessant demands from our own and our Allies
Army and Navy Medical Departments. Manufacturers of surgical
supplies from all over the country were appealed to.
Some had one kind of instrument, some another; from all of
them finally evolved a complete and excellently equipped hospital,
equalled by none afloat and surpassed by few ashore.
This one purchase required nearly six weeks of effort and search
to complete.</p>

<p>Some idea of the volume of supplies necessary to keep
the good ship running may be gathered from the following:</p>

<p>For washing the interior decks, etc., about six tons of soap,
six tons of soap-powder, and two tons of lye are used each trip.</p>

<p>The canvas bunk-bottoms represent an $85,000 purchase,
while $6,000 would be necessary to replace the bed sheets.
Blankets for the staterooms and hospital represent an expenditure
of $30,000, while one of the many manila mooring lines,
each 720 feet long, thirteen inches in circumference, and weighing
7,631 pounds, cost $2,403.77. The four-inch anchor chain
cost $2,869.42 for each ninety foot length.</p>

<h3>The U. S. S. Leviathan</h3>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> is 954 feet long, 100 feet beam, and, when leaving
New York, draws 41 feet 10 inches of water. Place her on Fifth Avenue
and she would spread from 42d Street across 45th Street. Stand her
on end alongside the Woolworth Building, and she would overtop the
Woolworth Building more than 50 feet. She weighs 69,000 tons; more
than twice the displacement of the world’s largest dreadnought.</p>

<p>She stows 8,700 tons of coal and carries 5,000 tons of fresh water.
If we would be permitted to run her at the speed she is capable of, she
would burn between 900 and 1,000 tons of coal a day. When we dock
at Hoboken she must have eighteen tug boats to assist her. She can
enter New York only on the high water, for the Ambrose Channel is not
dredged deeper than 40 feet. She can move at Hoboken only on the
slack water, for no amount of tugs could dock her at Hoboken while the
tide is running. Before the armistice she carried ten loads of troops
to Europe; about 4,500 officers and 100,000 men. Thus she has alone
handled one-twentieth of the A. E. F. Twenty Leviathans alone could
handle all the A. E. F. Alone, the <i>Leviathan</i> has placed in Europe
more U. S. Troops than Meade commanded at the decisive battle—Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Her Engineering Department requires 12 officers and 950 men.
Her Commissary Department requires 7 officers and 350 men. When
you have roast beef they have to cut up 40 steers.</p>

<p>During the war, on the eastward voyage, the Commissary Department
has fed 10,000 troops in 70 minutes, and at that permitting men
to come back for the second.</p>

<p>Even if the East River were deep enough her funnels are six feet
too high to go under the East River bridges.</p>

<p>Those on the bridge stand with their eyes 87 feet above water.
Against submarines we had eight six-inch guns and a supply of depth
charges always manned; but only twice have periscopes appeared, both
times in her rear. Both times the destroyers bombed at them well.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>Not only did the <i>Leviathan</i> carry a total of 14,300 persons on
board her 16th trip, 23 more than she has ever carried before,
but her trip from Sandy Hook to Brest and return is the fastest she
has ever made.</p>

<p>The <i>Leviathan</i> cleared Ambrose Channel on May 27th at 6:56 P.&nbsp;M.
and arrived June 11, at 3.00 A.&nbsp;M., or in a total elapsed time of only
15 days 8 hours and 4 minutes. Her best previous trip was when she
did the same circuit in 15 days 15 hours and 3 minutes, sailing on May
6th and next arriving at Ambrose Lightship on May 22nd.</p>

<p>Previous to this, her two best round trips were those of June and
July, 1918, when the pressure of troop movement to France was at its
height. These two trips were negotiated in 16 days 0 hours and 23
minutes, and 16 days 12 hours and 12 minutes respectively.</p>

<p>Not only has the <i>Leviathan</i> carried in the 15th and 16th trips a total
of 28,412 persons against 26,145 for her two best previous trips, but her
intervening stays in Hoboken between her last two trips was only 4
days, while the Hoboken layover between her two best former trips
was seven days.</p>

<p>Besides this record breaking showing, the boys of the <i>Leviathan</i>
found enough cash to subscribe $193,000 to Uncle Sam’s Victory Loan
while the Navy’s next best ship could only put up $129,000.</p>

<p>The 17th round trip established a new record of 14 days and 21
hours, when she carried 4,000 Army Officers and 3,000 troops, after
a stay of 40 hours in Brest, coaling (4,500 tons) and watering (3,000
tons).</p>

<p>On her 19th trip westbound, she carried General John J. Pershing
and his famous composite regiment selected from the entire A. E. F.</p>

<p>While under the German flag, the <i>Vaterland</i> (<i>Leviathan</i>) made
only one round trip and a half. She was ready for her return trip
August 1, 1914, but was held at Hoboken when the world war broke
out, July 30 of that year.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
